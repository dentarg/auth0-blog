## Aside: Securing Applications with Auth0

Are you building a [B2C](https://auth0.com/b2c-customer-identity-management), [B2B](https://auth0.com/b2b-enterprise-identity-management), or [B2E](https://auth0.com/b2e-identity-management-for-employees) tool? Auth0, can help you focus on what matters the most to you, the special features of your product. [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) can improve your product's security with state-of-the-art features like [passwordless](https://auth0.com/passwordless), [breached password surveillance](https://auth0.com/breached-passwords), and [multifactor authentication](https://auth0.com/multifactor-authentication).

[We offer a generous **free tier**](https://auth0.com/pricing) so you can get started with modern authentication.
