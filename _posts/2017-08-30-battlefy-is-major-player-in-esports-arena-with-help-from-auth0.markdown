**BELLEVUE, WA**—[Auth0](https://auth0.com), the leading Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) platform, is providing authentication to [Battlefy](https://battlefy.com/), an eSports management platform, to continue establishing its leadership in the rapidly-growing eSports industry. As part of a burgeoning market, expected to reach $1B by 2020, Battlefy has already organized more than 75,000 events at college clubs and national organizations around the country. Battlefy was in need of an easy-to-implement authentication platform that would provide increased security and a better user experience.

Rather than create authentication from scratch, Battlefy realized how much more time and cost-efficient it would be to implement Auth0 from the ground up. Auth0 provided the flexibility, extensibility, and security Battlefy was seeking, and quickly helped them achieve one major priority of eliminating sensitive user-private information from their own database.

“Auth0 is really the only identity service provider. We turned to them to replace existing social logins and gain the ability to remove password hashes from our database,” said Ronald Chen, Senior Software Developer, Battlefy. “They have great documentation, an easy-to-use API, and a great administrator panel.”

The implementation took less than a month and has given Battlefy a much more secure and seamless user experience. It also provided the company with the internal security it needs for its management tool that is accessed by Battlefy employees around the world. Due to the success of the implementation, Battlefy is assessing other ways to use Auth0, possible providing authentication to smaller companies who don’t have their own servers or infrastructure.
