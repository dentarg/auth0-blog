**BELLEVUE, WA -- January 8, 2018** – [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), a global leader in Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), today announced that it has been selected by [JDA Software Group, Inc.](http://www.jda.com/), as the identity and access management (IAM) solution for its next-generation solutions that are part of JDA NEXT, such as JDA Retail.me and JDA Store Optimizer. Using Auth0’s extensible platform, JDA will provide secure and seamless information access to its users. 

The JDA NEXT product strategy includes solutions that leverage edge technologies such as advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, machine learning, and SaaS to help retailers strategically plan and streamline operations around consumer buying behavior. With a need for Enterprise Federation across these solutions, JDA turned to Auth0 for its ease-of-implementation, flexibility, and compliance with modern security protocols. 

“After a thorough review of competitive IAM solutions, Auth0 provided the best platform that matched our focus on flexibility and the customer experience,” said John Vrankovich, principal architect at JDA. “It was much more cost-effective for us to outsource authentication to Auth0, and the fact that it could be implemented quickly across all our next-generation JDA solutions is what sealed the deal.”

Enterprise Federation requires a great deal of time and internal resources. With increasing demand across growing business networks for fast information and the need for control over access, Auth0 has become a trusted partner to companies like JDA, that need an extensible platform that easily integrates with any combination of APIs, identity providers, protocols, custom databases, and deployment models. 

“One of the primary reasons B2B organizations turn to Auth0 is Enterprise Federation. Relying on our platform allows companies to deliver results faster, more securely and efficiently than building internally, plus it eases developer resources to then focus on product innovation,” said Eugenio Pace, CEO and co-founder of Auth0. “We are very excited about working with JDA and growing with them as their far-reaching customer network continues to expand.”
