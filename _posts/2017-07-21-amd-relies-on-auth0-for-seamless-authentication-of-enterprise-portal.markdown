**BELLEVUE, WA**—Auth0, the leading Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) platform, announced that [AMD](http://www.amd.com/en/home) (NASDAQ: AMD), a leader in high-performance computing, graphics, and visualization technologies, is using Auth0 for authentication across its newly-built web portal for enterprise customers. As a result of the rapid implementation, AMD has realized a significant savings in identity-related development time, as well as successful Application Modernization of one of its legacy environments.

Auth0 provided a rapid and adaptable solution needed for AMD, as they were replacing a legacy Lotus/Domino platform with a new WordPress portal. The security and authentication offered by Auth0 enabled AMD to seamlessly merge the existing account user database into the new environment, and federate Active Directory domains for employees and customers, while keeping the portal’s confidential information secure.

“We were initially drawn to the simplicity of the solution and really appreciated not having to spend time doing extra coding,” said Kim Kane, Solution Architect - Developer Enablement Environment at AMD. “After a quick implementation, we were very impressed with the management interface of the Auth0 platform, as well as the support we received from their team. It has performed even better than we expected.”

The full implementation took less than a month to complete, giving AMD a more secure and improved experience for its enterprise customers. The positive experience with Auth0’s technology and support team has opened the door to other potential projects within AMD that are currently being discussed.
