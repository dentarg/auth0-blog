If you're struggling to cut through all the GDPR noise so you can figure out where your organization stands on changes to the EU's personal data regulations, you're not alone. In a recent [UK government survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2018-preparations-for-the-new-data-protection-act), less than half of the businesses surveyed were even aware of GDPR and its impending May 25, 2018 deadline, much less GDPR-compliant.

Launching a new product, managing a digital transformation, or handling day-to-day business is tough enough without the threat of GDPR's massive fines. Even though May is only months away, if you're already doing business in the EU or just have expansion plans, there is still time to moves towards compliance.

We've partnered with Cordery Compliance, a bespoke legal compliance company based in the UK, to create a self-serve **[GDPR assessment tool](https://auth0.com/gdpr-assessment/)** that will measure your readiness across 26 specific areas provisioned in GDPR.
