**TL;DR:** CakePHP is a PHP framework that makes building web applications faster and simpler. It possesses a powerful scaffolding system that reduces development time when building simple or complex systems. Currently, [CakePHP](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp) has over 7,000 stars on [Github](https://github.com) and a lot of organizations around the world use it to build great apps. In this tutorial, I'll show you how to build a web application with CakePHP and add authentication to it. Check out the [repo](https://github.com/auth0-blog/cakephp-auth0-got) to get the code.

**CakePHP** was developed by [Larry Masters](https://twitter.com/PhpNut). It emerged around 2005 as the first-ever PHP MVC framework. CakePHP has grown and evolved over the past decade as a prominent and go-to PHP framework. It is currently being maintained by the [CakePHP team](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/graphs/contributors). **CakePHP** ships with a lot of features out of the box, just like [Laravel](https://laravel.com). These features include:

* A built-in ORM that combines the power of ActiveRecord and DataMapper patterns
* Caching
* Authentication
* Scaffolding
* Built-in Validation

In January, 2017, [**Oven**](https://github.com/CakeDC/oven) was released by the CakePHP team. Oven is a tool for installing CakePHP without breaking a sweat. Recently, a few days ago to be precise, the CakePHP team tagged the latest release of the framework, *CakePHP 3.4.7*, otherwise known as Red Velvet. Tasty! It is a maintenance release for the 3.4 branch that fixes several issues submitted by developers. Checkout the [changelog here](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/3.4.6...3.4.7).

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

CakePHP also comes with a set of conventions to guide you in developing your application. It adopts the popular mantra that the Rails community is known for, *Convention over Configuration*.

{% include tweet_quote.html quote_text="Oven is a tool for installing CakePHP without breaking a sweat" %}

We'll be building a simple character listing app with **CakePHP 3.4**. Our app will simply list **10 Game of Thrones characters** and their real names. Once we add authentication to the app, all logged-in users will have the privilege of knowing these celebrity characters personally.


## Let's get started

CakePHP utilizes [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage its dependencies. So, before using CakePHP, make sure you have Composer installed on your machine. We can install CakePHP by issuing the Composer `create-project` command in your terminal:

```bash

composer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app got

```

or simply use **Oven**. In this tutorial, we'll use composer so that we can all get along easily. So go ahead and run the command above.

During the install, you might come across this error message:

![ext-int missing](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/cakephpgot/intlmissing.png)
_intl extension missing from your system_

Fear not! You simply need to enable the `intl` PHP extension in your PHP configuration.

As a Mac user like me, you can:

* Install the `intl` extension via homebrew: `brew install php71-intl`. If you are uing a lesser version of PHP like 5.6, then it will be `brew install php56-intl`.
* Restart apache `sudo apachectl restart`.

As a Linux user, you can:

* Install the intl extension:`sudo apt-get install php71-intl`. Use `sudo yum install php71-intl` if you are on CentOS or Fedora.
* Restart apache:`sudo service apache2 restart`.

As a Window & Xampp user, you can:

* Open your `php.ini` file and change `;extension=php_intl.dll` to `extension=php_intl.dll`
* Copy all the `xampp/php/ic*.dll` files to `xampp/apache/bin`.
* Restart Apache server

Let's check out the directory structure of our newly scaffolded project, **got** .

## Explore Directory Structure

CakePHP applications follow the **Model-View-Controller** architecture pattern.

![Model View Controller Diagram](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/laravel-auth/mvc-diagram.png)

*(Source: [Self Taught Coders](https://selftaughtcoders.com))*

In a nutshell,

  * **Models** query your database and return the necessary data.
  * **Views** are pages that render data
  * **Controllers** handle user requests, retrieve data from the Models and pass them into the views.

Read more about [MVC here](http://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-design/model-view-controller-explained/).

Let's checkout the directory structure of our CakePHP app. It contains the following directories and files:

* `bin` - contains all the CakePHP console executables.
* `config` - contains the configuration files CakePHP uses.
* `logs` - contains your application log files.
* `plugins` - contains your application plugins.
* `src` - contains your controllers, models, templates and views
* `tests` - contains all your test files
* `tmp` - temporary data is stored here. It also houses session information.
* `vendor` - contains the application dependencies. All the packages installed via composer.json reside here.
* `webroot` - contains all the files you want to be publicly accessible.
* `.htaccess`
* `composer.json` - composer file that houses the list and versions of PHP packages that your application depends on.
* `composer.lock` - composer file that locks down specific versions of installed PHP packages.
* `index.php`

## Setting Up The Controller

Open up your terminal and run the command below to create a `ListController`.

```bash
bin/cake bake controller List
```

The `bake` command generates a new controller with the `index`, `view`, `add`, `edit` and `delete` methods.

Open up `src/controller/ListController.php` and configure it like so:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

class ListController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
       $characters = [
         'Daenerys Targaryen' => 'Emilia Clarke',
         'Jon Snow'           => 'Kit Harington',
         'Arya Stark'         => 'Maisie Williams',
         'Melisandre'         => 'Carice van Houten',
         'Khal Drogo'         => 'Jason Momoa',
         'Tyrion Lannister'   => 'Peter Dinklage',
         'Ramsay Bolton'      => 'Iwan Rheon',
         'Petyr Baelish'      => 'Aidan Gillen',
         'Brienne of Tarth'   => 'Gwendoline Christie',
         'Lord Varys'         => 'Conleth Hill'
       ];

        $this->set(compact('characters'));
    }
}
```

Delete all other methods. We don't need it in this application.

`$this->set(compact('characters'))` indicates that the `characters` variable has been assigned to the view using the `set` method. It will hand down the query object collection to the view to be invoked with a foreach iteration. Let's create the view that will handle this controller.

## Setting Up The View

CakePHP views are just presentation-flavored fragments that fit inside an application’s layout. For most applications, they’re HTML mixed with PHP, but they may end up as XML, CSV, or even binary data.

CakePHP’s template files are stored in `src/Template` inside a folder named after the controller they correspond to (we’ll have to create a folder named ‘List’ in this case). Go ahead and create a `List` folder in `src/Template` directory. Next, create an `index.ctp` file and add this to it:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
            <div class="panel panel-success">
                <div class="panel-heading">List of Game of Thrones Characters</div>


                      <!-- Table -->
                      <table class="table">
                          <tr>
                              <th>Character</th>
                              <th>Real Name</th>
                          </tr>
                          <?php foreach($characters as $key => $value): ?>
                            <tr>
                              <td><?= $key ?></td><td><?= $value ?></td>
                            </tr>
                          <?php endforeach; ?>
                      </table>



            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

_index.ctp_

Go ahead and create a `Users` folder also in `src/Template` directory. Create an `add.ctp` and `login.ctp` file. The `add.ctp` file is the view for registering new users. The `login.ctp`is the view for users to log in.

Add this code in the `add.ctp` file:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<div class="users form">
<?= $this->Form->create($user) ?>
    <fieldset>
        <legend><?= __('Add User') ?></legend>
        <?= $this->Form->control('emailaddress', ['type' => 'email']) ?>
        <?= $this->Form->control('password') ?>
   </fieldset>
<?= $this->Form->button(__('Submit')); ?>
<?= $this->Form->end() ?>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

_add.ctp_

The `$this->Form->control` is a CakePHP [Form Helper](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/views/helpers/form.html).

Add this code in the `login.ctp` file:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<div class="users form">
  <?= $this->Flash->render() ?>
  <?= $this->Form->create() ?>
      <fieldset>
          <legend><?= __('Please enter your email address and password') ?></legend>
          <?= $this->Form->control('emailaddress', ['type' => 'email']) ?>
          <?= $this->Form->control('password') ?>
      </fieldset>
  <?= $this->Form->button(__('Login'), ['class' => 'btn btn-info']); ?>
  <?= $this->Form->end() ?>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

_login.ctp_

One more thing. We need to pull in bootstrap to beautify our views. Go ahead and open up `src/Template/Layout/default.ctp` file.

> The default file can be said to be the default master layout file for a CakePHP application.

In the `<head>` section, you will notice these two lines of code:

```php
<?= $this->Html->css('base.css') ?>
<?= $this->Html->css('cake.css') ?>
```

Add the link to bootstrap just above these lines of code:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
...
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-1q8mTJOASx8j1Au+a5WDVnPi2lkFfwwEAa8hDDdjZlpLegxhjVME1fgjWPGmkzs7" crossorigin="anonymous">


<?= $this->Html->css('base.css') ?>
<?= $this->Html->css('cake.css') ?>
...
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Scroll down a bit into the `<body>` section and comment out the nav section. We really do not need it.


## Setting Up The Routes

Open up `config/routes.php` and configure it like so:

```php
...
...
Router::scope('/', function (RouteBuilder $routes) {
    /**
     * Here, we are connecting '/' (base path) to a controller called 'Pages',
     * its action called 'display', and we pass a param to select the view file
     * to use (in this case, src/Template/Pages/home.ctp)...
     */

    $routes->connect('/', ['controller' => 'List', 'action' => 'index']);

    /**
     * Connect catchall routes for all controllers.
     *
     * Using the argument `DashedRoute`, the `fallbacks` method is a shortcut for
     *    `$routes->connect('/:controller', ['action' => 'index'], ['routeClass' => 'DashedRoute']);`
     *    `$routes->connect('/:controller/:action/*', [], ['routeClass' => 'DashedRoute']);`
     *
     * Any route class can be used with this method, such as:
     * - DashedRoute
     * - InflectedRoute
     * - Route
     * - Or your own route class
     *
     * You can remove these routes once you've connected the
     * routes you want in your application.
     */
    $routes->fallbacks(DashedRoute::class);
});
...
...
```

Delete the pages route. We don't need it.

Once a request hits the `/` route, it invokes the `index` method of the `ListController` and renders the returned value in the `index` view of the `List` template directory.

## Configuring the database

This application will require some info about users to be stored in the database since we intend to set up authentication. We'll set up the underlying MySQL database for our Game of Thrones app.

Open up **config/app** file, and scroll down to the `DataSources` key. Put in the username and password for accessing your MySQL database. Also, create a database called `got` and reference the name here:

```php
...
...
  /**
     * Connection information used by the ORM to connect
     * to your application's datastores.
     * Do not use periods in database name - it may lead to error.
     * See https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/6471 for details.
     * Drivers include Mysql Postgres Sqlite Sqlserver
     * See vendor\cakephp\cakephp\src\Database\Driver for complete list
     */
    'Datasources' => [
        'default' => [
            'className' => 'Cake\Database\Connection',
            'driver' => 'Cake\Database\Driver\Mysql',
            'persistent' => false,
            'host' => 'localhost',
            /**
             * CakePHP will use the default DB port based on the driver selected
             * MySQL on MAMP uses port 8889, MAMP users will want to uncomment
             * the following line and set the port accordingly
             */
            //'port' => 'non_standard_port_number',
            'username' => 'root',
            'password' => '',
            'database' => 'got',
            'encoding' => 'utf8',
            'timezone' => 'UTC',
            'flags' => [],
            'cacheMetadata' => true,
            'log' => false,

            /**
             * Set identifier quoting to true if you are using reserved words or
             * special characters in your table or column names. Enabling this
             * setting will result in queries built using the Query Builder having
             * identifiers quoted when creating SQL. It should be noted that this
             * decreases performance because each query needs to be traversed and
             * manipulated before being executed.
             */
            'quoteIdentifiers' => false,

            /**
             * During development, if using MySQL < 5.6, uncommenting the
             * following line could boost the speed at which schema metadata is
             * fetched from the database. It can also be set directly with the
             * mysql configuration directive 'innodb_stats_on_metadata = 0'
             * which is the recommended value in production environments
             */
            //'init' => ['SET GLOBAL innodb_stats_on_metadata = 0'],

            'url' => env('DATABASE_URL', null),
        ],
...
...
```

You can check if you are connected to the database by simply checking the default landing page that was shipped with the CakePHP installation:

![Connect to database](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/cakephp/connect_to_database.png)
_Connected to database_

> Mac Users can use SequelPro to manager their database.

**Note:** You would have to refactor the route code to point back to the `Pages` controller.


## Setting Up Authentication

Authentication is the process of identifying users by provided credentials and ensuring that users are who they say they are. Let's set it up in our app. CakePHP provides different ways of authenticating users in your app:

* **FormAuthenticate** - User authentication via form POST data.
* **BasicAuthenticate** - User authentication via Basic HTTP authentication.
* **DigestAuthenticate** - User authentication via Digest HTTP authentication.

In our app, we'll use **FormAuthenticate**. Thankfully, CakePHP's `AuthComponent` supports it by default.

CakePHP doesn't have a full-fledged built-in auth system like Laravel. So, a developer has the option of using the `AuthComponent` and then configuring it with forms, views, controllers and models or pulling in ready made full-fledged auth plugins like the ones listed in [Friends of Cake GitHub repository](https://github.com/FriendsOfCake/awesome-cakephp#authentication-and-authorization).

![CakePHP issue about built-in auth](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/cakephp/authissue.png)
_CakePHP built-in auth issue_

Go ahead and create the users table in the database:

```bash
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    emailaddress VARCHAR(255),
    password VARCHAR(255),
    role VARCHAR(20),
    created DATETIME DEFAULT NULL,
    modified DATETIME DEFAULT NULL
);
```

> It is advisable to use a tool like PHPMyAdmin or SequelPro, so that you can just paste the query in the tool and run it rather than using the command line.

![Create users table](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/cakephp/createuserstable.png)
_Create users table_

The next step is to create our `UsersTable` class. Open up `src/Model/Tables` directory and create a file, `UsersTable.php`. Now add this code to it:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Model\Table;

use Cake\ORM\Table;
use Cake\Validation\Validator;

class UsersTable extends Table
{

    public function validationDefault(Validator $validator)
    {
        return $validator
            ->notEmpty('emailaddress', 'An email address is required')
            ->notEmpty('password', 'A password is required');
    }

}
```

Next, create the `UsersController` using the bake command:

```bash
bin/cake bake controller Users
```

Now, open your controller file and delete every method except `add`, `beforeFilter`, `login` and `logout`.

We need to modify some of the methods in our UsersController.

The `add` method is responsible for adding/saving a new user. So go ahead and modify to look like this:

_add_

```php
 /**
     * Add method
     *
     * @return \Cake\Http\Response|null Redirects on successful add, renders view otherwise.
     */
    public function add()
    {
        $user = $this->Users->newEntity();
        if ($this->request->is('post')) {
            $user = $this->Users->patchEntity($user, $this->request->getData());
            if ($this->Users->save($user)) {
                $this->Flash->success(__('The user has been saved.'));

                return $this->redirect(['controller' => 'list', 'action' => 'index']);
            }
            $this->Flash->error(__('The user could not be saved. Please, try again.'));
        }
        $this->set(compact('user'));
        $this->set('_serialize', ['user']);
    }
```

In the code above, a check is done to ensure it is a POST request coming in. The user data is also obtained from the request and saved using the User Entity class.


_login_

```php
public function login()
    {
        if ($this->request->is('post')) {
            $user = $this->Auth->identify();
            if ($user) {
                $this->Auth->setUser($user);
                return $this->redirect($this->Auth->redirectUrl());
            }

            $this->Flash->error(__('Invalid email or password, try again'));
        }
    }
```

The error has been changed to `Invalid email or password, try again`. We are using email and password to authenticate instead of username and password.

In the code above, `$this->Auth->identify()` identifies the user using credentials provided in the request, then saves the user information to session using `$this->Auth->setUser($user)`. This line of code logs the user in.

_logout_

```php
 public function logout()
    {
        $session = $this->request->session();
        $session->destroy();
        return $this->redirect($this->Auth->logout());
    }
```

In the code above, we added code to destroy the session and redirect back to the list view via CakePHP's logout method. Now, you might be wondering. How do we know where it will redirect to?

Open up `src/Controller/AppController.php` file, go into the `initialize` method and modify it like this:

_initialize_

```php
public function initialize()
    {
        parent::initialize();

        $this->loadComponent('RequestHandler');
        $this->loadComponent('Flash');
        $this->loadComponent('Auth', [
            'loginRedirect' => [
                'controller' => 'List',
                'action' => 'index'
            ],
            'logoutRedirect' => [
                'controller' => 'List',
                'action' => 'index'
            ],
            'authenticate' => [
                'Form' => [
                    'fields' => ['username' => 'emailaddress']
                ]
            ]
        ]);
    }
...
```

A lot is going on in the code above. Just relax, I'll explain. We loaded CakePHP's Auth Component and passed in three keys, `loginRedirect`, `logoutRedirect` and `authenticate`.

* **loginRedirect** - The user will be redirected to `/list` because the List controller and index action will be invoked.
* **logoutRedirect** - The user will be redirected to `/list` because the List controller and index action will be invoked.
* **authenticate** -  `username` is used by default when performing the user identification and login action. We switched to `emailaddress`, therefore, informing CakePHP's Auth handler about the change.

In the code above, we changed the `redirect` function slightly to include the list controller and index action. This simply means we want the user to be redirected to the list page once registered successfully.

> **Note:** The index method returns the data for the route `/list`

We haven't taken care of something very important. Open up `src/Controller/AppController.php` and check out the `beforeFilter` function. This function acts as a middleware, it intercepts requests coming in. Here, you can determine the kind of routes you want an authenticated user to be able to access or not. You can also set an `authenticated` status based on users logged-in or logged-out status.

Modify the `beforeFilter` function like this:

```php
...
...
public function beforeFilter(Event $event)
{
    $this->Auth->allow(['index','view']);
    $this->set('loggedIn', $this->Auth->user());
}
```

`$this->Auth->allow(['index'], 'view'])` allows the `index` and `view` action of every controller in our app to be accessible whether the user is logged in or not.

`$this->set('loggedIn', $this->Auth->user())` sets a `loggedIn` variable that we can use in the view to conditionally display some items based on the user logged in status. If the user is not logged in, `$this->Auth->user()` returns `null` which is a falsey value.

### Update Views

We need to update our views to conditionally show the list of Game of Thrones characters based on whether the user is logged in or not.

Open up `List/index.ctp` and modify it like this:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
            <div class="panel panel-success">
                <div class="panel-heading">List of Game of Thrones Characters</div>
                  <?php if($loggedIn): ?>
                    <br />
                    <?= $this->Html->link('Logout', '/users/logout', ['class' => 'btn btn-danger']); ?>

                    <hr />

                    <table class="table">
                          <tr>
                              <th>Character</th>
                              <th>Real Name</th>
                          </tr>
                          <?php foreach($characters as $key => $value): ?>
                            <tr>
                              <td><?= $key ?></td><td><?= $value ?></td>
                            </tr>
                          <?php endforeach; ?>
                    </table>
                  <?php else: ?>
                    <br />
                    <div align="center">
                      <h5> You need to login to have access to this list <?= $this->Html->link('Login', '/users/login', ['class' => 'btn btn-info']); ?> </h5>
                    </div>
                  <?php endif; ?>
            </div>

        </div>
    </div>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the code above, you can see how we're conditionally using the `$loggedIn` variable to display the logout, login buttons and the list of characters. Awesome!

### Run The App

If you server is not up yet, then go ahead and run `bin/cake server` in your terminal. Try out the app:

## Aside: Using Auth0 with CakePHP

**Auth0** issues [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) on every login for your users. This means that you can have a solid [identity infrastructure](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), including [single sign-on](https://auth0.com/docs/sso/single-sign-on), user management, support for social identity providers (Facebook, Github, Twitter, etc.), enterprise identity providers (Active Directory, LDAP, SAML, etc.) and your own database of users with just a few lines of code.

We can easily set up authentication in our CakePHP apps with [Auth0's Centralized Login Page](https://auth0.com/docs/hosted-pages/login). If you don't already have an Auth0 account, <a href="https://auth0.com/signup" data-amp-replace="CLIENT_ID" data-amp-addparams="anonId=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name)">sign up</a> for one now. Navigate to the Auth0 [management dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/), select **Applications** from the navigational menu, then select the app you want to connect with **CakePHP**.

> Auth0 provides the simplest and easiest to use [user interface tools to help administrators manage user identities](https://auth0.com/user-management) including password resets, creating and provisioning, blocking and deleting users. [A generous **free tier**](https://auth0.com/pricing) is offered so you can get started with modern authentication.

* Navigate to the Auth0 [management dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/).
* Create a new client

    ![Create a new client](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/cakephp/create_client.png)

* Give it a name and select the type of app as `Regular Web Applications`.

    ![CakePHP GOT](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/cakephp/got.png)

* Take note of the *client_id*, *domain*, and *secret*. You'll need it soon.

### Step 1: Install and Configure CakePHP Auth0 package

**Important Notice** The package you are about to install was not developed by Auth0. It is a community package.

Go ahead and install the [cakephp package](https://github.com/jsoftb/auth0) via composer.

> You have to set `minimum-stability` to `dev` in your composer.json file for the package to install successfully. Note that installing `dev-master` is not best practice. You should not do this in production.

### Step 2: Register the callback

Head over to your Auth0 [dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/) and register a callback in **Allowed Callback URLs** like so: `http://localhost:8765/users/login`

Open up your `AppController`and add this to the initialize function:

```php
...
$this->loadComponent('Auth', [
            'authenticate' => [
                'Auth0.Auth0' => [
                                  'domain'        => '<domain_value_provided_by_auth0>',
                                  'client_id'     => '<client_id_value_provided_by_auth0>',
                                  'client_secret' => '<client_secret_value_provided_by_auth0>',
                                  'redirect_uri'  => '<redirect_uri_value_provided_by_auth0>'
                ]
            ],
]);
```

Replace the placeholder values with the credentials on your dashboard. I recommend that you load them from environment variables to prevent your credentials especially the **secret** from been leaked.

### Step 3: Configure Auth0's Centralized Login Page

Open up `List/index.ctp` and add the following:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<script src="https://cdn.auth0.com/js/auth0/9.0.0/auth0.min.js"></script>
<script>
  var webAuth = new auth0.WebAuth({
    domain: 'YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN',
    clientID: 'YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID'
  });

  function signin() {
    webAuth.authorize({
      responseType: 'code',
      redirectUri: 'YOUR_AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL'
    });
  }
</script>

<button onclick="window.signin();">Login</button>
...
...
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

When the login button is clicked, users are redirected to Auth0's Centralized Login Page.

![Auth0 centralized login screen](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/resources/auth0-centralized-login.jpg)

### Step 4: Configure your UsersController

Configure the `login` method of your `UsersController` like this:

```php
public function login()
    {
        $authCode = $this->request->query('code', null);
        if(!is_null($authCode)) {
          $user = $this->Auth->identify();
          if($user) {
            $this->Auth->setUser($user);
            return $this->redirect($this->Auth->redirectUrl());
          }
        }
    }
```

Now, once a user registers, it stores the user information in your Auth0 user database. The CakePHP plugin retrieves the user info and sets it so that it is accessible in `$this->Auth0->user()`.

### Step 4: Configure Logout

Modify the `logout` function in `UsersController` to this code below:

```php
public function logout()
    {
        $url = $this->Auth->logout();
        $this->request->session()->destroy();
        return $this->redirect($url);
    }
```

Now, when you click the logout button, the user will be successfully logged out.

**Important API Security Note:** If you want to use Auth0 authentication to authorize _API requests_, note that you'll need to use [a different flow depending on your use case](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/which-oauth-flow-to-use). Auth0 `idToken` should only be used on the client-side. [Access tokens should be used to authorize APIs](https://auth0.com/blog/why-should-use-accesstokens-to-secure-an-api/). You can read more about [making API calls with Auth0 here](https://auth0.com/docs/apis).

## Wrapping Up

Well done! You have just built your first app with CakePHP. As we saw in this tutorial, you can easily add authentication to your CakePHP apps. This tutorial is designed to help you get started on building your own apps with CakePHP. You can leverage the knowledge gained here to build bigger and better apps.
