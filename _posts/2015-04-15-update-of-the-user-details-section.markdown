**TL;DR**

  * We have redesigned the user's profile page to use the new [API v2](https://auth0.com/docs/apiv2).
  * API v2 brings an improved way of [handling metadata](https://auth0.com/docs/apiv2Changes#8). In short, metadata will be stored in a separate section (__app\_metadata__ and __user\_metadata__) on the user structure and not merged with root attributes, which had caused confusion before.
  * The data you've modified in our previous dashboard version or using API v1 is now under __app\_metadata__.
  * This is a change on the __Dashboard__, not on the runtime. There are __no breaking changes__ to your apps.

Good news! We have redesigned the user's profile page in order to make use of the new [API v2](https://auth0.com/docs/apiv2).

User's data is now separated in three sections, each one with different meanings according to what it represents.

### User Identity Section

On the main section you will find essential data such as the user's email and login access information.

### Metadata Section

The __Metadata__ section is the part of the user's data that you can modify.

In the previous user's profile, the _metadata_ was merged with the user's root-level attributes which created some confusion. To make everythig more explicit and easier to find, we've decided to keep it separate.

If you modified user attributes in the past through the dashboard, you will find the additional attributes under __app\_metadata__  after this change (since the dashboard was using API v1).

> [Learn more](https://auth0.com/docs/apiv2Changes#8) about when to use __app\_metadata__ vs __user\_metadata__.

### Identity Provider Attributes Section

Last but not least, there's the __Identity Provider Attributes__ section. Here you will find all the information retrieved from the authentication provider (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google, SAML, your own provider, etc.).

This data is read-only. Let's say you'd like to modify the picture that is coming from the Facebook profile. You won't be able to change the attribute in the __Identity Provider Attributes__ section. Instead you need to set the `picture` attribute in the `user_metadata` property and then in your application you would do:

```
<img src="<%= user.user_metadata.picture || user.picture %>">
```

The previous code snippet tries to use the `picture` property from `user_metadata` and if it doesn't exist it uses the default (`user.picture`).

### Raw JSON

Finally, you can easily take a look at the raw JSON format that will be served by our API at the new __Raw JSON__ tab.
