**TL;DR:** Bootstrap is the de-facto design frontend component library for designing web and mobile sites. In this article, I'll cover the new features in Bootstrap 4.0 and several other changes and deprecations.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We never stopped believing, and hope you didn’t either! Bootstrap 4.0.0 has finally landed! <a href="https://t.co/zFAOxpyhvD">https://t.co/zFAOxpyhvD</a></p>&mdash; Bootstrap (@getbootstrap) <a href="https://twitter.com/getbootstrap/status/954061442940002304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2018</a></blockquote>

Bootstrap is built and maintained by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo), [@fat](https://twitter.com/fat) and a core team of developers. It is an open source toolkit that provides a responsive grid system, Sass variables and mixins, prebuilt components for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. 

Bootstrap 4.0 final release was announced to the world on January 19, 2018, after the alpha version was released three years ago. Bootstrap 4 is a major rewrite of the entire project. It is such a huge milestone for the Bootstrap team to tag the 4.0.0 release after many years of hard work squashing bugs, improving the framework and polishing the documentation. Let's go through the major changes in Bootstrap from the v4.0.0-beta to version 4.0.0. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nearly three years of personal open source work and energy has gone into this thing. Words cannot express how happy I am that it’s out. Now, on to v4.1! <a href="https://t.co/XgpZzzDNoY">https://t.co/XgpZzzDNoY</a></p>&mdash; Mark Otto (@mdo) <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo/status/954062092037795840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2018</a></blockquote>

## 1. Normalize Dropped, Reboot Here to Stay

Before version 4-beta, Normalize.css was a dependency in Bootstrap used for rendering the consistent appearance of all the HTML elements across the board. The team decided to drop the dependency, fork some of it and remixed it with Bootstrap's [Reboot](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/reboot/) for a better and stable normalization approach.

## 2. Major Browser Support Change

Bootstrap v4.0 now supports Internet Explorer 10+ and iOS 7+. Furthermore, it added official support for Android v5.0 Lollipop's Browser and WebView. 

Unfortunately, it dropped support for IE8, IE9 and iOS 6. If you are building applications that need support for these browser versions, use Bootstrap v3.

## 3. Giant Move to Flexbox

With Bootstrap v4, Flexbox is enabled out of the box. Flexbox ships with a lot of awesome features, thus making Bootstrap v4 very rich with benefits such as a Flexbox based grid, responsive sizing and floats, auto margins, vertical centering, auto-layout grid and even new spacing utilities. Flexbox also powers the new card components.

## 4. Improved Grid System

With Bootstrap version 4, an improvement has been made to make it a 5 grid tier system, _xs_, _sm_, _md_, _lg_, and _xl_. The new grid tier, _xl_, extends the media query range all the way down to **544px**. 

The improved grid system also offers the following:

- Support for flexbox in the grid mixins and predefined classes.
- Support for vertical and horizontal alignment classes.
- Changes in media queries to avoid repeating query declarations.

    ```js
    @include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {

    }
    @include media-breakpoint-down(sm) {

    }
    @include media-breakpoint-only(sm) {

    }
    ```
- Changed grid mixins to merge `make-col-span` into `make-col` for a singular mixin.

Check out this awesome [Bootstrap 4 Grid Demo on Codepen](https://codepen.io/ncerminara/pen/ZGgJVa/).

## 5. Media Queries on Steriods

The `@screen` format no longer exists in Bootstrap v4.0. Now, you can just use media queries easily like the example below:

    ```css
    // Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
    // No media query since this is the default in Bootstrap

    // Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)
    @media (min-width: 576px) { ... }

    // Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
    @media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

    // Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)
    @media (min-width: 992px) { ... }

    // Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)
    @media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }
    ```

The new `media-breakpoint-up()`, `media-breakpoint-down()`, `media-breakpoint-between`, or `media-breakpoint-only()` can be used like so:

- `@media (min-width: 576px) and (max-width: 767.98px) { ... }` can be used as `@include media-breakpoint-only(sm) { ... }`.
- `@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991.98px) { ... }` can be used as `@include media-breakpoint-only(md) { ... }`.
- `@media (min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) { ... }` can be used as `@include media-breakpoint-only(lg) { ... }`.
- `@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }` can be used as `@include media-breakpoint-only(xl) { ... }`.
- `@media (max-width: 575.98px) { ... }` can be used as `@include media-breakpoint-down(xs) { ... }`.
- `@media (max-width: 767.98px) { ... }` can be used as `@include media-breakpoint-down(sm) { ... }`.
- `@media (min-width: 576px) { ... }` can be used as `@include media-breakpoint-up(xs) { ... }`.
- `@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }` can be used as `@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) { ... }`.

An example of media queries spanning multiple breakpoint widths such as `@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) { ... }` can be used as `@include media-breakpoint-between(md, xl) { ... }` in a sass mixin.


## 6. Improved Form Support in Bootstrap 4

In Bootstrap 4, the default checkboxes and radios have been rewritten to have the same layout styles.

Form classes we were very familiar with in version 3 have been modified like so:

- `.control-label` is now `.col-form-label`.
- `.input-lg` and `.input-sm` is now `.form-control-lg` and `.form-control-sm`, respectively.
- `.form-group-*` classes are now `.form-control-*` classes.
- `.help-block` is now `.form-text` for block-level help text. Utility classes like `.text-muted` can be used for inline help text.
- No more `.radio-inline` and `.checkbox-inline`.
- The `.checkbox` and `.radio` classes have metamorphosed into `.form-check` and the various `.form-check-*` classes.
- `.has-error`, `.has-warning`, and `.has-success` classes have been replaced with HTML5 form validation via CSS’s `:invalid` and `:valid` pseudo-classes.
- `.col-form-legend` no longer exists.

Check out [more information on forms](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration/#forms-1).

## 7. Sass By Default, Less Eliminated 

Bootstrap v3 uses [Less](http://lesscss.org/) for source CSS files. With Bootstrap v4, [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is now used for source CSS files. From project experiments across the world, frontend developers tend to favour Sass over Less. Sass is very flexible and also compiles faster!

## 8. Elevated Card Components

Bootstrap v4 dropped support for **panels**, **thumbnails**, and **wells** in favor of the new **card** component built with Flexbox. The card component provides a flexible and extensible content container with multiple variants and options. It includes options for headers, footers, contextual background colours and powerful display options.

Functionality for panels, thumbnails and wells are available as modifier classes for cards.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<div class="card">
  <img class="card-img-top" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/unicodeveloper/image/upload/c_fill,h_800,w_600/v1515417610/Screen_Shot_2018-01-08_at_2.17.49_PM_v4xp58.png" alt="Card image cap">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Profile Picture</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Prosper Otemuyiwa, Developer Advocate</p>
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Visit Profile</a>
  </div>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

You can have:

- `class="card-body"` which is the building block.
- `class="card-header"` which gives you a header within a card.
- `class="card-footer"` which gives you a footer within a card.
- `class="card-info"`
- `class="card-inverse"`
- `class="card-warning"`
- `class="card-danger"`
- `class="card-success"`

All these classes are available as styling for header elements such as `.card-warning` to a `<h2>`,`<h3>` element.

Cards have no specific width so they'll be 100% wide by default. Custom CSS, grid classes and mixins can adjust it to whatever you want.

## 9. Spacing Utilities

Bootstrap includes a plethora of shorthand responsive margin and padding utility classes to modify an element’s appearance. This simply works by assigning responsive-friendly margin or padding values to an element with shorthand classes.

Here's a psuedocode of its representation, `{margin or padding}-{sides}-{size}`. An example is:

```bash
.mt-2 {
  margin-top: 2 !important;
}

.ml-3 {
  margin-left: ($spacer * .25) !important;
}
```

Check out [more information on spacing utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/spacing/).

## 10. Improved Tooltip auto-placement Support

Bootstrap v4 ships with improves support for auto-placement of tooltips, popovers and dropdowns. Bootstrap 4 dropped support for [Tether.js](https://github.com/HubSpot/tether/) in favour of [Popper.js](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js) which does a great job and is actively maintained.

  ```js
    $(function () {
      $('[data-toggle="tooltip"]').tooltip()
    })
  ```

  {% highlight html %}
  {% raw %}
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Tooltip on top">
    Tooltip on top
  </button>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" title="Tooltip on right">
    Tooltip on right
  </button>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Tooltip on bottom">
    Tooltip on bottom
  </button>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Tooltip on left">
    Tooltip on left
  </button>
  {% endraw %}
  {% endhighlight %}
    
  // Enable Popovers everywhere
  
  ```js
    $(function () {
      $('[data-toggle="popover"]').popover()
    })
  ```

## Deprecations and Other Updates

* The global font-size has been increased from `14px` to `16px`.
* The primary CSS unit is now `rem` rather than `px`. However, pixels are widely used for media queries.
* Bootstrap 4 dropped the Glyphicons icon font. Suggested options are [fontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/).
* Bootstrap 4 also dropped the **Affix JQuery library**. Suggested option is to use the `position:sticky` polyfill.
* Bootstrap 4 dropped support for non-responsive usage of Bootstrap.
* Bootstrap 4 uses a user's system fonts, with a fallback to Helvetica Neue, Arial, and sans-serif.

## Upgrading to Bootstrap 4

The Bootstrap team has a comprehensive guide for [migrating to Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration). However, there is a very [nifty tool](http://upgrade-bootstrap.bootply.com) from the community that allows you to drop in a piece of code and convert it to the Bootstrap v4 equivalent.
