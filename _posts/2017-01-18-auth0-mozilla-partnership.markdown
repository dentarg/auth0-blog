**BELLEVUE, WA** - As of November 30, 2016, Mozilla, one of the largest open-source organizations on the web, has replaced their longstanding Persona authentication system and has instead chosen Auth0 for all of their identity and access management (IAM) needs moving forward. The removal of Persona also means that Mozilla will no longer offer a public-facing authentication service. 

Auth0 has already been integrated in many Mozilla web properties including [Mozillians](https://mozillians.org/), [Mozilla Moderator](https://moderator.mozilla.org/), and [Mozilla Reps](https://reps.mozilla.org/). Mozilla is making use of Auth0’s [passwordless authentication](https://auth0.com/passwordless), [LDAP](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders#enterprise), and [social connections](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders#social) features to make it easier for contributors and employees to gain access to the various services Mozilla provides.

We are honored to have Mozilla as both a customer and ally. Auth0 has always embraced and contributed to the open-source community and we built our platform around open standards like OAuth and [OpenID Connect](https://auth0.com/security) so that our platform can easily integrate and interoperate in any organization while still following industry standards and best practices.

### About Auth0

Auth0 provides frictionless authentication and authorization for developers. The company makes it easy for developers to implement even the most complex identity solutions for their web, mobile, and internal applications. Ultimately, Auth0 allows developers to control how a person’s identity is used with the goal of making the internet safer. As of August, 2016, Auth0 has raised over $24m from Trinity Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, K9 Ventures, Silicon Valley Bank, Founders Co-Op, Portland Seed Fund and NXTP Labs, and the company is further financially backed with a credit line from Silicon Valley Bank.
