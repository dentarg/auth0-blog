We are very happy to announce that Auth0 is now available in the Windows Azure Store as an Add-on.

<!-- more -->

Integrating it into your Azure apps is now even easier, and takes just 2 steps:

###1. Enter the name of your Auth0 instance:

![azure store addon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog.auth0.com/img/auth0-azurestore-name.png)

This name will be used to generate your own domain in Auth0:

> https://{NAME}.auth0.com

###2. Complete the purchase:

![azure store addon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog.auth0.com/img/auth0-azurestore-purchase.png)

After a couple minutes, your instance of Auth0 will be provisioned and ready to use right from the Windows Azure Portal.

When you click on __"Manage"__, you will be taken to Auth0's dashboard. No other credentials are required as we are completely integrated with Azure.

You'll see a welcome message from [Matias](https://twitter.com/woloski) and links to [tutorials](https://docs.auth0.com/azure-tutorial) to get you started:

That's it! Feedback is very much welcome. Please connect with us on the [our chat room](http://chat.auth0.com) or [open a support ticket](https://support.auth0.com).

We want to thank the Windows Azure team for their support in getting this done. A special thanks to [Bilal Aslam](http://www.linkedin.com/in/bilalaslam)!

If you are developing on node.js, and are interested in creating add-ons for Windows Azure, check out the basic template we published [here](https://github.com/auth0/node-azure-store). It'll save you some time.

> During the beta period we are offering Auth0 for free up to 1000 users. That should give you plenty of room for testing.
