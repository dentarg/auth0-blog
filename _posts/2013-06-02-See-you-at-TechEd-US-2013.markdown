Going to [TechEd USA](http://northamerica.msteched.com/) this week? So am I! [Nick Harris](https://twitter.com/cloudnick) was very kind to invite us to his session: [Build Real-World Modern Apps with Windows Azure Mobile Services on Windows Store, Windows Phone or Android](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/WAD-B338)

####Abstract
_Join me for and in-depth walkthrough of everything you need to know to build an engaging and dynamic app with Mobile Services. See how to work with geospatial data, multiple auth providers (including custom identity), periodic push notifications and your favorite APIs through scripts. We'll begin with a Windows Store app then point Windows Phone and Android apps to the same Mobile Service in order to ensure a consistent experience across devices. Weâ€™ll finish up with versioning APISs._

And you probably guessed it right. I'll be covering the _how to work with custom identity_ with Azure Mobile Services.

This is a 300 level session, so come prepared for quite a deep dive! Look forward to meeting you there.

The session is on Wednesday 5th, but I'll also be around on [Tuesday 4th](http://northamerica.msteched.com/Agenda#day-2) for the __Ask the Experts__ and __Jam Sessions__. If you want to meet 1:1, send me an e-mail: eugeniop AT auth0.com
