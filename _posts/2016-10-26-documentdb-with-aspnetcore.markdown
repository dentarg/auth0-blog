**TL;DR:** This article continues the journey we [started](https://auth0.com/blog/auth0-with-azure-documentdb/) with Azure DocumentDB. In this installment, we will learn how to build common query patterns and services with ASP.NET Core. A full working application sample is available as a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ealsur/auth0documentdb/).

## Integration between Auth0 and Azure DocumentDB
In our previous article: [Integration between Auth0 and Azure DocumentDB](https://auth0.com/blog/auth0-with-azure-documentdb/) we configured an **integration** between Auth0 and Azure DocumentDB as a Custom Database Provider to store our enrolled users in JSON format, as [documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database).

Conceptually, in Azure DocumentDB, a _database_ can be defined as a logical container of document collections; each _collection_ can hold not only documents but _stored procedures_, _triggers_, and _user-defined functions_. The collection is the [billable unit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/documentdb/) and defines the [consistency level](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/documentdb-consistency-levels/).

![DocumentDB element hierarchy](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/aspnetcore-and-documentdb/hierarchy.png)

## Querying and storing data on Azure DocumentDB
Azure DocumentDB collections have [automatic attribute indexing](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-indexing/), which can also be [customized](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-indexing-policies/). This **schema-free** approach lets you store documents with different and dynamic structures that can evolve over time.

Since we are storing our users on DocumentDB, this means we can also **store other object types** in the same collection without their interfering with each other.

We will work with a practical pattern to achieve this multiple-type storage and build performance-wise querying examples; even though DocumentDB supports [Node.js](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-nodejs-get-started/), [Python](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-sdk-python/), [Java](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-sdk-java/), and [.Net](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-get-started/) SDKs, we'll be working on the latter. A [full sample on GitHub](https://github.com/ealsur/auth0documentdb/) is available running on ASP.NET Core.

### Dependencies
Using ASP.NET Core, we will use the _project.json_ to define dependencies. We will only need the [Azure DocumentDB Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB.Core/) on the latest version:

```javascript
{
    ...
    "Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB.Core":"0.1.0-preview"
    ...
}
```

### Base Type Pattern
We start by creating a base abstract class with _Type_ and _Id_ attributes. All DocumentDB objects have an id attribute that can be auto generated (as a Guid) or set upon creation:

```cs
public abstract class Entity
{
    public Entity(string type)
    {
        this.Type = type;
    }
    /// <summary>
    /// Object unique identifier
    /// </summary>
    [Key]
    [JsonProperty("id")]
    public string Id { get; set; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Object type
    /// </summary>
    public string Type { get; private set; }
}
```

>You might notice the [JsonProperty](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/t_newtonsoft_json_serialization_jsonproperty.htm) decorator. This is because the "id" attribute on DocumentDB is always lowercase; the decorator will make sure the property name matches, no matter what your JSON serialization configuration is.

Now, every object type you want to store on DocumentDB can **inherit** from this class and set its own attributes:

```cs
public class NotificationPreferences : Entity
{
    public NotificationPreferences():base("notificationpreferences")
    {
        Email = false;
        Push = false;
        SMS = false;
    }
    [JsonProperty("user")]
    public string User { get; set; }
    [JsonProperty("email")]
    public bool Email { get; set; }
    [JsonProperty("push")]
    public bool Push { get; set; }
    [JsonProperty("sms")]
    public bool SMS { get; set; }
}
```

```cs
public class ContactAddress : Entity
{
    public ContactAddress():base("address")
    {
        Primary = false;
    }
    [JsonProperty("user")]
    public string User { get; set; }
    [JsonProperty("address")]
    public string Address { get; set; }
    [JsonProperty("primary")]
    public bool Primary { get; set; }
}
```

### Performant Querying
Azure DocumentDB allows for insert, update, delete, and querying capabilities on different flavors, including LINQ and SQL syntax.

>If you already have your data in another format / source, you can use the Azure DocumentDB [Data Migration tool](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-import-data/) to migrate it to a collection.

The following operations are available as a [full provider](https://github.com/ealsur/auth0documentdb/blob/master/Services/DocumentDbProvider.cs) on the GitHub repository; we will highlight the snippets that will enable you to understand the basic operations.

To successfully connect to a DocumentDB collection we will need the **service url endpoint** and the **password/key** (when using the MongoDB protocol-enabled version it's called _Password_ and when using a normal DocumentDB instance it's called _Key_) obtained on the Azure Portal. They will enable us to access the service through a [DocumentClient](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/microsoft.azure.documents.client.documentclient.aspx).

Like we mentioned [earlier](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-resources/), documents are grouped in collections within a database, each collection is accessed by a [Resource URI syntax](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn919266.aspx). The SDK provides helper methods to build URIs:

```cs
private  Uri GetCollectionLink()
{
    return UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri(_settings.DatabaseName, _settings.CollectionName);
}
```

We always start by creating an instance of a DocumentClient and using it in every access operation. A common performance tip is to maintain a single DocumentClient for all our queries and operations:

```cs
public DocumentDbProvider(DocumentDbSettings settings)
{
    _settings = settings;
    _collectionUri = GetCollectionLink();
    _dbClient = new DocumentClient(_settings.DatabaseUri, _settings.DatabaseKey, new ConnectionPolicy(){
        MaxConnectionLimit = 100
    });
    _dbClient.OpenAsync().Wait();
}
```

>For other performance best practices, there is an [entire article](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-performance-tips/) on this topic.

We will now cover the **basic operations**.

#### Inserting documents
For a generic insertion that works for any object type we can use:

```cs
public async Task<string> AddItem<T>(T document)
{
    var result = await _dbClient.CreateDocumentAsync(_collectionUri, document);
    return result.Resource.Id;
}
```

This will internally use [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/newtonsoft.json/) to serialize your object to JSON and store it. If you set the id property it will be maintained; if you don't, it will create a new Guid string. This also means that you can exclude attributes from serialization with the [JsonIgnore](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/serializationattributes.htm) attribute.

#### Updating documents
The same simple procedure works on updates:

```cs
public async Task<string> UpdateItem<T>(T document, string id)
{
    var result = await _dbClient.ReplaceDocumentAsync(GetDocumentLink(id), document);
    return result.Resource.Id;
}
```

With a helper that obtains a document URI:

```cs
private Uri GetDocumentLink(string id)
{
    return UriFactory.CreateDocumentUri(_settings.DatabaseName, _settings.CollectionName, id);
}
```

>Azure DocumentDB **does not support partial updates** at the time of this article's writing. If you try to do it, you will end up with a replaced document with fewer attributes than it had originally.

#### Deleting a document
Deleting a document is as simple as:

```cs
public async Task DeleteItem(string id)
{
    await _dbClient.DeleteDocumentAsync(GetDocumentLink(id));
}
```

It requires a Document URI, which can be created with our previous helper method.

#### Querying documents
Queries can be performed using [SQL syntax](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-sql-query/) or [LINQ to DocumentDB syntax](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/documentdb-sql-query/#linq-to-documentdb-sql). Building a generic query method is as simple as:

```cs
public IQueryable<T> CreateQuery<T>(FeedOptions feedOptions)
{
    return _dbClient.CreateDocumentQuery<T>(_collectionUri, feedOptions);
}
```

Or for a SQL syntax query:

```cs
public IQueryable<T> CreateQuery<T>(string sqlExpression, FeedOptions feedOptions)
{
    return _dbClient.CreateDocumentQuery<T>(_collectionUri, sqlExpression, feedOptions);
}
```

You might notice a [FeedOptions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.azure.documents.client.feedoptions.aspx) attribute. This lets you define things like the size of result sets or pagination. If we are creating a query that will return just one result, it‚Äôs a performant good practice to set the [MaxItemCount](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.azure.documents.client.feedoptions.maxitemcount.aspx) property to 1:

```cs
var feedOptions = new FeedOptions() { MaxItemCount = 1 };
```

[IQueryable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/bb351562.aspx) can be chained, meaning that following our Type object pattern, we can create queries for different object types based on the same internal function:

```cs
_provider.CreateQuery<OneType>(feedOptions).Where(x => x.Type == "onetype");
_provider.CreateQuery<OtherType>(feedOptions).Where(x => x.Type == "othertype");
```

On the [related repository](https://github.com/ealsur/auth0documentdb/blob/master/Extensions/DocumentDbLinqExtensions.cs) there are a couple of **extensions** that might simplify your queries, like a **TakeOne**, which returns a single object (or null) from a IQuerable:

```cs
var feedOptions = new FeedOptions() { MaxItemCount = 1 };
return  _provider.CreateQuery<SomeClass>(feedOptions).Where(x => x.Type == "someclass" && x.OtherProperty == someValue).TakeOne();
```

Finally, pagination can be achieved through the [RequestContinuation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.azure.documents.client.feedoptions.requestcontinuation.aspx#P:Microsoft.Azure.Documents.Client.FeedOptions.RequestContinuation) attribute on the [FeedOptions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn948725.aspx#P:Microsoft.Azure.Documents.Client.FeedResponse`1.ResponseContinuation). We obtain this value by querying first and then saving the ResponseContinuation attribute.

```cs
var documentQuery = myIQueryAble.AsDocumentQuery();
var queryResult = await documentQuery.ExecuteNextAsync<T>();
var responseContinuationToken = queryResult.ResponseContinuation;
```

The repository includes an extension to solve this scenario by a [PagedResults](https://github.com/ealsur/auth0documentdb/blob/master/Extensions/DocumentDbLinqExtensions.cs#L28) wrapper:

```cs
public async Task<PagedResults<MyClass>> GetContactAddresses(int size = 10, string continuationToken = "")
{
    var feedOptions = new FeedOptions() { MaxItemCount = size };
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(continuationToken))
    {
        feedOptions.RequestContinuation = continuationToken;
    }
    return  await _provider.CreateQuery<MyClass>(feedOptions).Where(x => x.Type == "myClass").ToPagedResults();
}
```

Notice how we set the **page size** by the MaxItemCount attribute of the FeedOptions.

#### Dependency injection
When working on ASP.NET Core, one of the core features is Dependency Injection. Because of this, it‚Äôs vital that our DocumentDB provider is wrapped in a [service](https://github.com/ealsur/auth0documentdb/blob/master/Services/DocumentDbService.cs) that can be injected by an [interface](https://github.com/ealsur/auth0documentdb/blob/master/Services/IDocumentDbService.cs).


A simple way to do this is to create a service class that receives an **IConfiguration** (possibly coming from your [appsettings.json](https://github.com/ealsur/auth0documentdb/blob/master/appsettings.json) file) and creates an instance of our DocumentDbProvider:

```cs
private readonly DocumentDbProvider _provider;
public DocumentDbService(IConfiguration configuration)
{
    _provider = new DocumentDbProvider(new DocumentDbSettings(configuration));
}

```

By implementing an interface, we can maintain a single copy of our service through the **IServiceCollection** available on our [Startup.cs](https://github.com/ealsur/auth0documentdb/blob/master/Startup.cs#L31) file:

```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAuthentication(
        options => options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
    services.AddSingleton<IDocumentDbService>(x=>new DocumentDbService(Configuration.GetSection("DocumentDb")));
    services.Configure<Auth0Settings>(Configuration.GetSection("Auth0"));
    

    services.AddMvc();
    services.AddOptions();
}
```

This way, it‚Äôs easy to _inject_ it in an MVC Controller:

```cs
public class ProfileController : Controller
{
    private readonly IDocumentDbService _dbService;
    public ProfileController(IDocumentDbService dbService)
    {
        _dbService = dbService;
    }
}
```

#### Partitions and parallelism in Azure DocumentDB
Collections can **scale dynamically** with Azure DocumentDB‚Äôs [partition support](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-partition-data/#single-partition-and-partitioned-collections). Partitioned collections have a potentially higher throughput and require a Partition Key configuration. Single-partition collections cannot be changed to Partitioned collections, so **plan ahead**: if your application data might grow beyond 10GB or you need more than 10,000 Request Units per second, you might as well evaluate Partitioned collections.

![DocumentDB Partitioned collections](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/aspnetcore-and-documentdb/partitioned.png)

Furthermore, each of the operations we described earlier will require an additional Partition Key value as part of the [RequestOptions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.azure.documents.client.requestoptions.aspx) class.

Partitions help optimize throughput by allowing us to take advantage of parallel queries on multiple collections by using .Net‚Äôs [Task Parallel Library](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd460717.aspx).

>For a more detailed look at implementing Partition querying, take a look at the [official sample GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-dotnet/tree/master/samples/code-samples/Partitioning).

## Aside: Using Auth0 with Azure DocumentDB
Azure DocumentDB can be integrated as a [custom database provider](https://auth0.com/blog/auth0-with-azure-documentdb) by [using the MongoDB protocol](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-create-mongodb-account/). 

Create a custom database connection by going to the _Connections > Database_ in your [Auth0 management dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/) and build your MongoDB _connection string_ by obtaining the credentials from your Azure DocumentDB account on the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com):

`mongodb://<your_service_name>:<your_password>==@<your_service_name>.documents.azure.com:10250/auth0?ssl=true` 

You can then use it on your **Database Action Scripts** sections.

For a step by step guide, you can view [Planet-scale authentication with Auth0 and Azure DocumentDB](https://auth0.com/blog/auth0-with-azure-documentdb/)

## Conclusion
Azure DocumentDB is a fast and flexible cloud storage service that will work on almost any use case scenario and can work along with Auth0 in a highly streamlined fashion.
Remember that a **full sample**, including extensions and providers, is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ealsur/auth0documentdb).
