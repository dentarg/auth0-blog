**BELLEVUE, Wash. -- March 28, 2018** -- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), a global leader in Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), announced that it is providing the identity platform for [Youi Insurance](https://www.youi.com.au/) (“YouInsured™”), a leading insurance provider in Australia that offers a range of motor and home insurance policies. Youi is relying on Auth0’s social login functionality for its Youi Rewards app, a mobile customer platform for earning rewards with policy purchases or file claims.  

Youi’s people-first mission is the foundation for all customer interaction, and they were looking for a way to improve the user experience of their Rewards app as demand increased. The existing custom-built app did not incorporate social login, which posed a barrier to adoption. Execution speed and the assurance of the security of user data also played a large role in making the decision to standardize on Auth0. 

“We had several technical requirements in mind when evaluating identity providers,” said Doug Inman, Group Chief Information Officer at Youi. “Ultimately, Auth0’s ability to get us up and running right away and simultaneously improve our customers’ experience made it an easy decision.” 

“Youi has a reputation for being customer-centric, and we are proud to play a role in keeping their customers happy,” said Eugenio Pace, CEO of Auth0. “Consumers are demanding more from their engagement with brands, and Youi is a great example of a company using technology to anticipate and meet customer needs.”
