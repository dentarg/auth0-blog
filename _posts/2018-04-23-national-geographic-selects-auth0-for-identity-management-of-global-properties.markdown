**BELLEVUE, Wash. -- April 23, 2018** -- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), a global leader in Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), today announced that it has been selected by [National Geographic Partners, LLC](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/) (NGP) to centralize identity for its global properties, spanning tens of millions of users in 172 countries. Auth0 will be used across the brand to unify a standardized identity platform, which will increase user adoption and improve National Geographic customers’ entire online experience. 

National Geographic, a recognized leader in premium science, adventure, and exploration content across an unrivaled portfolio of media assets, was seeking a way to provide a cohesive digital experience to its global customers and provide a more seamless way to access rich content across its breadth of brands. Auth0’s Universal Identity Platform provides all the features to achieve that, and was the only solution that could quickly be integrated into National Geographic’s existing technology infrastructure without any major disruption to its consumers.  

“Centralizing identity for our global brand is a huge undertaking and priority for us - one that has many layers of complexity, from a technology standpoint,” said Nik Khilnani, Senior Director of Platform Development, National Geographic. “We needed a solution that could be standardized across all our properties and be able to scale to our tens of millions of global customers as we fully roll-out. Auth0 is that solution.” 

“Our platform’s extensibility and the advanced competence and vision of National Geographic’s development teams will make the integration even easier, enabling their consumers to reap the benefits right away and set them up for long-term success,” said Eugenio Pace, CEO and Co-founder of Auth0. “National Geographic is a time-honored brand and we are looking forward to a great partnership with them.”

National Geographic will begin implementation for its North American properties, and then expand to different regions worldwide, with the goal of having one centralized identity platform for global users across the entire brand.
