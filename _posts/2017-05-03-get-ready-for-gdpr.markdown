## Introduction

The data protection and security landscape is all set for change next year with the new [EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)](https://auth0.com/gdpr). There will be regulatory burdens, but you can also use GDPR to bring some focus on what you do and improve your security stance.  Remember...

* The new rules are part revolution/part evolution - the new system builds on the current one if you already comply with EU privacy laws you can build on those foundations;
* Don’t panic, plan instead - the full impact will come in 2018 but preparation now will pay off then.

At Cordery we’ve been working on GDPR projects since the first draft came out in 2012. GDPR is a long document but here’s some highlights:

## Reach

The new rules will apply to all those in the EU who control data and/or undertake data processing.

* All sectors are affected - the more robust your privacy compliance the better your market advantage;
* Non-EU businesses doing business in the EU are also affected.

Identity management has a role to play in GDPR to help you work out whether data subjects are who they say they are and whether they are in scope for different aspects of GDPR. Establishing identity is also essential when someone tries to exercise new rights which GDPR creates.

## What are those new rights?

New rights are being introduced and existing ones tweaked, including.

* A new Right To Data Portability;
* An extended Right To Be Forgotten (called the Right to Erasure);
* An enhanced Subject Access Right - to be free and with a shorter time to reply.

## Data Protection Impact Assessments ("DPIAs")

DPIAs will have to be undertaken for certain data processing operations.

DPIAs put the compliance assessment burden on those handling personal data - but, used as a wider tool they help you get a better handle on your data processes and reduce risk. This should help you build privacy and security into the heart of what you do. There’s no set format - the key thing is to pick a process that is simple to understand and helps you get to the real risks quickly.

### Security Breach Reporting

One of the most important changes is that there will be mandatory security breach reporting.

Breaches must be reported to a regulator within 72 hours and those affected by the breach must also be informed - to do this you must have clear, practical, effective and immediate procedures. You’ll also need to get your vendors and suppliers on board - this is business critical so you can’t afford to get it wrong.

### Greater Penalties

Increased enforcement will come about with the new regime, backed up by [greater sanctions](https://resources.auth0.com/whitepaper/gdpr-fine-determination/).

There are fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the global annual revenue of a business (whichever is the greater), with likely higher reputational damage resulting and the possibility of civil actions too. This is the big stick for data protection compliance, but, getting it right will avoid major headaches.

## Aside: Securing Applications with Auth0

Are you building a [B2C](https://auth0.com/b2c-customer-identity-management), [B2B](https://auth0.com/b2b-enterprise-identity-management), or [B2E](https://auth0.com/b2e-identity-management-for-employees) tool?
