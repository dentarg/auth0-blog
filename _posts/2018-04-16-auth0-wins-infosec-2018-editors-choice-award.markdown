We believe that fighting cybercrime can begin with your IAM solution. 

Looks like Cyber Defense Magazine agrees.

Today they announced the winners of their [2018 InfoSec Awards](http://www.cyberdefensemagazine.com/infosec-awards-2018-winners/), naming Auth0 as “Editor’s Choice” for Identity and Access Management. Reaching a growing audience of more than 1.2+ million, Cyber Defense is considered a premier source of IT Security Information.

“With Cybercrime continuing to gain momentum, surpassing global drug crime last year and reaching over $600B in theft and damages, we are proud to see Auth0 as an award-winning innovator, offering a new approach to defeat these criminals,” said Pierlugi Paganini, Editor-in-Chief, Cyber Defense Magazine.

Nearly 3,000 companies globally competed for InfoSec recognition in categories ranging from _Advanced Persistent Threat to Wireless, Mobile, or Portable Device security_. To narrow the selection to just 200 winners, Cyber Defense looked for innovation, as well as ability and drive to help customers “get ahead of the next data breach.”

_“Auth0 takes security and identity and access management seriously,”_ said Auth0 CISO Joan Pepin. _“In this evolving cyber crime environment, we will continue to keep our focus on innovating to address the latest attacks. Our main concern is producing secure, high-quality products for our customers and their customers.”_
