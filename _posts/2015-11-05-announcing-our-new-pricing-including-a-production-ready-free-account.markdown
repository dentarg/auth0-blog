At Auth0 we‚Äôre shipping new pricing today üëèüí∏. As some of you may know, finding the right pricing and packaging is one of the hardest things a company does. That‚Äôs true even more for a platform like Auth0, given the enormous number of different use cases the Auth0 platform addresses.  Five months ago, we decided to focus on creating the best possible new pricing. As Auth0 is a company by engineers, for engineers, we wanted to use the most analytical possible approach to pricing, and hence both crunched a lot of data, and also incorporated qualitative feedback we received from our subscribers, in order to create a new version of Auth0 pricing and packaging that we think will have broad appeal to everyone from developers, startups and small businesses to the very largest global enterprises.

## These are the 5 major changes:

<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-9">
  <strong>Free Plan including 7,000 monthly active users</strong>: We believe that using Auth0 with a basic setup (username/password, 2 social providers or passwordless authentication) versus implementing it yourself (using <a href="http://passportjs.org/">passportjs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">devise</a>, etc.) should be a no-brainer decision for any developer. For that reason starting today we are giving away the Auth0 runtime and API for free for up to 7,000 monthly active users.  Note this number of active users could support a much much larger number of registered users, depending on how frequently your users authenticate (for e.g. if your app has a 15%  active usage, this supports 50,000 registered users). For many new products, web sites and projects, this is more than enough to get started, and best of all you will have an infrastructure ready to enable multi-factor authentication, enterprise integrations,  account linking, and many other powerful features just a flip of a dashboard switch away, no extra code needed.

  <strong>Internal vs External users</strong>: Our subscribers use Auth0 to either protect applications used by employees (internal usage) or by non-employees (external usage). Our new plans take this into account.
