Auth0 is now available on [Heroku as an add-on](https://addons.heroku.com/auth0) (private beta for now), making it __incredibly easy__ to add Enterprise SSO, Consumer Logins, Directories queries, user access audit and many advanced identity management to any app hosted there. [See here for a complete list of supported identity providers in Auth0](http://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders): Consumer and Enterprise.
