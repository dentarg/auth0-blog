We are happy to announce the [Auth0 Partners](https://auth0.com/partners) program. Our goal at Auth0 has always been to deliver a frictionless identity management platform so developers could focus on building their unique applications. With social connections, enterprise SSO, multifactor authentication and much more available at the flip of a switch, we believe we've fulfilled that goal.

Through collaborative partnerships, Auth0 partners can leverage our industry leading tools and expertise to deliver proven solutions to their customers.

## Why a Partners Program?

Partnering with Auth0 enables system integrators and digital agencies who develop applications to **accelerate time to market**, **decrease development costs**, and **reduce risk** by offloading identity management to Auth0 so that they can focus on implementing business value. Auth0 offers generous resell and referral margins while providing pre and post-sales support to ensure joint success.

### Technology Partner

Technology Partners leverage the Auth0 platform to integrate, market and sell their own software solutions including SaaS and mobile applications, or extend the Auth0 platform with value added capabilities.

Our Technology Partners take two forms. ISV and SaaS providers who embed Auth0 to provide their identity management for their applications, and partners who extend the Auth0 platform through sophisticated identity scenarios that previously were not possible.

### Solution Partner

Solution Partners consult, resell, refer and help customers find and integrate the right identity solutions for both new and existing applications. Our Solution Partners integrate identity solutions into complex environments with unique organizational needs.

Whether you need a consultation or implementation of an identity system, [our partners](https://auth0.com/partners#find-a-partner) are here to help. Reach out and we'll get you in touch with one of our worldwide partners.
