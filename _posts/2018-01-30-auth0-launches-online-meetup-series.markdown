**BELLEVUE, Wash., January 30, 2018** – [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), a global leader in Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), today announced that it has launched an ongoing online meetup series that will feature leading experts to comment on current trends in the identity, authentication, and security industries. The first meetup, focused on “Security in 2018” will occur **Wednesday, February 7, 2018,  from 6-7 p.m. PST**. Registration for this free, online event is available at: [https://www.meetup.com/Auth0-Online-Meetup/](https://www.meetup.com/Auth0-Online-Meetup/).

Today’s ever changing security landscape requires an agility and a level of preparedness that many companies strive to achieve. The demands are high, but the stakes are even higher. This discussion will examine the changing security landscape, the potential impact of vulnerabilities like Spectre and Meltdown, as well as security trends and predictions for 2018. Security panel experts will also answer: "What keeps you up at night?"
