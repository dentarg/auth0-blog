**TL;DR** Developers have a lot of options when deciding to build mobile apps. Xamarin allows developers to build cross-platform apps using C#. Learn how to build a cross-platform Android and iOS application utilizing a single codebase and add user authentication with Auth0.

---

The importance of having a great mobile app cannot be understated. The good news is developers have a lot of options on how to build mobile apps. **Native**, **hybrid**, **responsive web** - and the frameworks that come with them - give developers a lot of flexibility and they all have pros and cons. Native development will likely grant the best performance, but you'll have to maintain each platform separately. Hybrid development will allow you to target multiple platforms with one codebase, but you won't get the same performance. Responsive web will allow you to convert your web app to a mobile friendly version quickly, but you won't be able to access the native device features and APIs nor the app stores.

While learning new technologies is great, many developers like to stick to the rule of thumb which states that you should build with the technology you are most familiar with and use the right tool for the job. Building a native iOS app for the "performance" benefits when you have zero Objective-C knowledge will likely yield a negative result. [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/) is a framework for building cross-platform applications in C#, so if you've ever worked with the Microsoft technology stack, you should feel right at home. In today's post, we'll build a cross-platform iOS and Android app with Xamarin.

## Why Xamarin?

Xamarin allows you to build native iOS, Android, Windows and Mac applications in C#. The company was founded by the creators of [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) and recently [acquired](https://blog.xamarin.com/a-xamarin-microsoft-future/) by Microsoft. Over 1 million developers are using Xamarin to build apps like [CineMark](http://www.cinemark.com/mobile-apps-cinemode), [MixRadio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mixradio.droid&hl=en) and [Bastion](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bastion/id537773100?mt=8). Xamarin is a great fit for companies who are already embedded in the Microsoft stack and have developers with extensive C# knowledge. The Xamarin Platform runs on both Windows and Mac so you truly are not limited to the Windows ecosystem but have the full strength of C# at your disposal.

{% include tweet_quote.html quote_text="Xamarin allows you to build native iOS, Android, Windows and Mac applications in C#." %}

C# is an excellent programming language. Statically typed, object-oriented, garbage collected and asynchronous are just some of the benefits. With Xamarin, your entire app will be written in C# and then compiled to it's native binary. The Xamarin Platform exposes platform specific APIs when needed, interfaced again with C#, but generally you will be able to write the majority of your code once and have it run everywhere.

## Getting Started with Xamarin

Let's dive in and set Xamarin up. The first thing we'll need is the actual Xamarin Platform installed on our machine. Head over the the Xamarin website and [download](https://www.xamarin.com/download) it. Once downloaded, the installer will ask you which platforms you are planning on developing for and will download additional dependencies automatically. If you are developing on a Windows machine, you can alternatively use Visual Studio, but as this is a tutorial introducing Xamarin, we'll stick to Xamarin Studio.

### Setting Up the Solution

![Xamarin Studio New Solution](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/xamarin/xamarin-studio-setup-solution.png)

With Xamarin Studio installed, we are ready to create our first project. Open up Xamarin Studio and click the **New Solution** button in the top left corner to get started. The first screen we're presented with will ask us what type of application we're building. We'll select **Cross-Platform App** as we're building an application that we want available on iOS and Android. We'll select a **Xamarin.Forms** app and on the next screen we'll name our app - **CloudCakes**, select our target platforms (Android and iOS) and select the **Use Shared Library** in the sharing section. The Shared Code selection does not matter much for us in this demo but to learn about the differences and when you might use one over the other check out the Xamarin [docs](https://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/building_cross_platform_applications/sharing_code_options/).

![Xamarin Solution Setup](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/xamarin/solution-setup.png)

Finally, we'll select a directory for our project and we'll be ready to go.

### Project Structure

With a new solution created, let's explore how Xamarin setup the project for us. There are three root level directories: **CloudCakes**, **CloudCakes.Droid**, **CloudCakes.iOS** - or if you named your app something different it'll follow the pattern **{AppName}**, **{AppName}.Droid**, **{AppName}.iOS**. We will spend the majority of our time in the main directory as any code written here will be shared between the Android and iOS versions of the app. The more code we can write in the main directory the better.

![Xamarin Project Structure](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/xamarin/xamarin-directory-structure.png)

The platform specific directories are for writing code that will only execute on the target platform such as NFC on Android or different implementations of touch and gestures between platforms. Xamarin has already taken care of the code required to launch our apps on both Android and iOS so we should be able to just start writing code in the shared directory, build our solution and see the results. Before we start, if you open the `AppDelegate.cs` file on the iOS side and the `MainActivity.cs` on the Droid side, you'll be able to see platform specific code implemented to launch the app. If you've developed native iOS or Android apps in the past, these file names should be familiar as they match the app instantiation files for the native platforms.

### Hello World in Xamarin

Before we write our app, let's quickly open up the `CloudCakes.cs` or `{AppName}.cs` in the shared code directory. This is the entry or main function into our application. Xamarin has added some boilerplate code when it created the solution that just displays a message once the app is opened. To make sure this runs, let's build and run the solution. To do this, simply click the play icon in the top left corner of the screen and the iOS Simulator should launch with our Xamarin app and display the message "Welcome to Xamarin Forms!" Now let's build our app.

*Since we are developing on a Mac, we have defaulted to using the iOS simulator for a majority of our examples, if you are on a Windows machine you can use the Android or Windows Mobile emulators and should have the same experience.*

## CloudCakes Goes Mobile

The app we'll be building today is called **CloudCakes**. If you've been keeping up with the Auth0 blog, you may remember CloudCakes from our post a few weeks ago where we [migrated](https://auth0.com/blog/2016/02/16/migrating-your-parse-users-to-auth0/) users from Parse to Auth0. CloudCakes is an app that allows you to get cake on demand. Up until now, you'd have to use your computer or the web responsive version of the CloudCakes website to place orders. Due to overwhelming requests, you've decided that a native mobile application is needed. Let's see how we can accomplish this with Xamarin.

 CloudCakes is a fairly simple app. We need a way to authenticate a user, allow users to view cakes and place orders, an about page for newcomers and a signup page to convert new users into "Cake Enthusiasts." Let's start with the **About** page as it is the simplest and will give us a chance to familiarize ourselves with how Xamarin works.

### About Us
The **About Us** page will give some general information about our app. Let's start by creating a new file in the shared directory. Right click on the main shared directory and navigate to the **Add** menu, in the submenu select **New File**. A new dialog box will appear giving you options for the type of file you'd like to create. As we are building a **Xamarin.Forms** app, we'll stay in the Forms section, and here we'll have 4 options for the type of files we'd like to create. We can create a **Forms ContentPage**, **Forms ContentPage Xaml**, **Forms ContentView** or **Forms ContentView Xaml**.

A **ContentPage** defines the entire view of the screen. **ContentView** on the other hand can be viewed as a section of the page. You can use multiple ContentViews to build out a ContentPage. Additionally, you have two choices in how you want to build the UI for your application. The first option is to build your UI with C# and the second option is to use XAML to build out the UI and hook up functionality via an underlying C# file. You can build the same UI's with either option but we've chosen to go with building all of our UI's in C# as there is a lot of content to cover and adding XAML on top of it would make for a very long tutorial.

We'll select the **Forms ContentPage** template and name it `AboutPage`. Xamarin will now create the template and add some boilerplate code we can work with. Let's see what Xamarin generated.

```
using System;
using Xamarin.Forms;

namespace CloudCakes
{
  public class AboutPage : ContentPage
  {
	public AboutPage ()
	{
	  Content = new StackLayout {
	    Children = {
          new Label { Text = "Hello ContentPage" }
		}
	  };
    }
  }
}
```

This is fairly standard C# code. The page was created in the CloudCakes namespace, a new class called `AboutPage` was created that inherits `ContentPage` which will allow us to build our our UI. Finally, the main method for this class was created called `AboutPage()`. The `Content` variable is how we build the UI using Xamarin Forms and C#. Here we declare the type of layout we'd like, global page parameters such as padding or line spacing and then we include any components that we want the user to see. In the boilerplate example, we simply display a text label that says "Hello ContentPage." Let's write the code for the AboutUs page and examine it closer.

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Xamarin.Forms;

namespace CloudCakes
{
  public class AboutPage : ContentPage
  {
	public AboutPage ()
	{
	  var title = new Label {
		Text = "About Us",
		FontSize = Device.GetNamedSize (NamedSize.Large, typeof(Label)),
		HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.CenterAndExpand,
	  };
	  var description = new Label {
		Text = "CloudCakes aims to revolutionize the cake delivery business by delivering on-demand cakes and other treats with the click of a button. No longer will you need to go to the store or even remember your favorite type of cake - just signup for an account and you're good to go!"
	  };

	  var blogTitle = new Label {
		Text = "In The News",
		HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.CenterAndExpand
	  };

	  List<string> articles = new List<string> {
		"CloudCakes raises $50m and leads the Cake-as-a-Service models",
		"Top 10 Cities With the Best Cakes",
		"CloudCakes CEO awarded for Food Innovation Award 2016"
	  };

	  ListView articlesView = new ListView {
		ItemsSource = articles
	  };

	  Content = new StackLayout {
		Padding = 30,
		Spacing = 10,
		Children = { title, description, blogTitle, articlesView }
	  };
	}
  }
}
```

We've added a lot of code here. The first thing we did was add a `label`, which is just a text area, for the title. Labels can have many different properties such as font size, color, position and in the title label we've decided to increase the font and center the text horizontally. The `description` label does not have any special characteristics so we just inserted the text. Next, we created a third label for a subheading and then created a list of news articles. We first created an array of articles and then created a Xamarin Forms `ListView` component and populated it with the array of articles. Finally, to display all this to the user we created a `StackLayout`, which simply stacks components one on top of the other in the order provided, and populated it with the four components we created. To provide some better styling we added some padding and vertical spacing between the components.

To see our About Us page in action, let's go to the `CloudCakes.cs` file in the shared code directory and have the About Us page load on app startup. To accomplish this, we can remove the boilerplate code that displays the "Welcome to Xamarin Forms!" and instead instantiate the `MainPage` variable with our newly created about page.

```
public App ()
  {
    MainPage = new AboutPage();
  }
```

Launch the iOS simulator and you should see the newly created About Us page.

![CloudCakes About Page](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/xamarin/cloudcakes-about-page.png)

### Orders Page

Next, let's build the UI for the Orders Page. On this page, users will place orders for different types of cakes. For the UI here, we'll want to display the user information and a list of cakes a user can order. The user will be able to click on a cake they want we'll display a message saying that the cake has been ordered. Let's take a look at the code. *We'll add comments and explanations inline with the code from here on out*.

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Xamarin.Forms;

namespace CloudCakes
{
  public class OrdersPage : ContentPage
  {
	public OrdersPage ()
	{
	  // We've created a new class for holding user data.
	  User user = new User {
		Email = "ado@email.com",
		Avatar = "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1770570?v=3&s=460"
	  };

	  // We've also created a new class to hold the cake information.
	  List<Cake> cakes = new List<Cake> {
		new Cake ("Chocolate Overload", 15.99),
		new Cake ("Red Velvet Cake", 19.99),
		new Cake ("Strawberry Fusion", 14.99)
	  };

	  // Instead of using the StackLayout like in the about page
	  // we've opted to use a GridLayout to have more flexibility
	  Grid grid = new Grid{
		Padding = 30
	  };

	  // The GridLayout adds elements slightly differently
	  // The first parameter is the element we are adding -
	  // in this case we create an anonymous Image.
	  // Additionally, we specify where we want the image to
      // be displayed in the grid. Here we've chosen 0, 0 which
	  // means the image will be placed in the top left corner
	  grid.Children.Add(new Image
	  {
		Aspect = Aspect.AspectFit,
		WidthRequest = 60,
		HeightRequest = 60,
		Source = ImageSource.FromUri(new Uri(user.avatar)),
	  }, 0,0 );

	  grid.Children.Add(new Label
	  {
		Text = user.Email,
		HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center,
		VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center
	  }, 1, 0);

	  // We loop through the available cakes and create a
	  // button for each.
	  for (var i = 0; i < cakes.Count; i++) {
		Button button = new Button {
		  Text = cakes [i].Name + " ($" + cakes [i].Price + ")",
		  VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center,
		};

	    // We implement a general click event that displays a popup
	    // saying that an order was placed
	    // Note: In a real world scenario you would likely use a closure
	    // if you were implementing this functionality - but for simplicity
	    // sake we just kept it simple.
	    button.Clicked += (object sender, EventArgs e) => {
		  DisplayAlert ("Order Placed", "Your cake order has been placed and will arrive in 15 minutes", "OK");
	    };

	    // We add the buttons to the grid. In this case
	    // we pass additional parameters to have greater
	    // control over how the content is displayed
	    grid.Children.Add(button, 0, 2, i+1, i+3);
	  }

      // Finally we pass our grid into the Content variable
	  Content = grid;
	}
  }

  // This is where we create our two custom classes for the User and Cake objects
  public class User {
    public string Email { get; set;}
    public string Avatar { get; set;}
  }

  public class Cake {
    public string Name { get; set;}
	public double Price { get; set;}

	public Cake(string name, double price){
	  this.Name = name;
	  this.Price = price;
	}
  }
}
```

To see the newly created Orders page, let's go back into the `CloudCakes.cs` file and instead of loading up the About Us Page, let's load up the Orders page. Simply replace the `MainPage = new AboutPage();` with `MainPage = new OrdersPage();` and launch the simulator. If all went well you should see the orders page. *Note: We haven't implemented user authentication yet - so we've added some static content for the user for now.*

![CloudCakes Order Page](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/xamarin/cloudcakes-order-page.png)

### Signup Page

The Signup Page will allow users to create new accounts. We will omit any email validation and to make signups as easy as possible just require an email and password. Let's build the UI.

```
using System;
using Xamarin.Forms;

namespace CloudCakes
{
  public class SignupPage : ContentPage
  {
	public SignupPage ()
	{
	  // A new element we're creating here - the Entry element
      // Entry allows us to capture user input
      // We are adding a Placeholder attribute to tell the user
      // which data we want them to enter
	  var email = new Entry {
		Placeholder = "Email"
	  };

	  // Similar to the email entry button, we capture the
      // users password here. To hide the password from being
      // displayed we set the `IsPassword` attribute to true
	  var password = new Entry {
		Placeholder = "Password",
		IsPassword = true
	  };

	  var signupButton = new Button {
		Text = "Sign Up"
	  };

	  signupButton.Clicked += (object sender, EventArgs e) => {

	  };

	  Content = new StackLayout {
		Padding = 30,
		Spacing = 10,
		Children = {
		  new Label { Text = "Signup for a CloudCakes Account", FontSize = Device.GetNamedSize (NamedSize.Large, typeof(Label)), HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center },
		  email,
		  password,
		  signupButton
		}
	  };
    }
  }
}

```

Now that we've implemented the UI, let's update the `CloudCakes.cs` file and set the `MainPage` to our newly created signup page to make sure that it works and looks how we expect it to. We haven't added the implementation for the signup so clicking on the signup button will not do anything yet. Let's run the simulator and see how are signup page will look.

![CloudCakes Signup Page](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/xamarin/cloudcakes-signup-page.png)

### Homepage

The homepage of our application will also act as the login page. As users cannot place orders without first logging in, it wouldn't make sense to give them access to anything else before they are authenticated. In this section we will create the UI for the login page - we'll add the functionality later on in this tutorial. Let's look at the code that is going to make up our homepage/login page.

```
using System;
using Xamarin.Forms;

namespace CloudCakes
{
  public class HomePage : ContentPage
  {
	public HomePage ()
	{

	  var title = new Label {
		Text = "Welcome to CloudCakes",
		FontSize = Device.GetNamedSize (NamedSize.Large, typeof(Label)),
		HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.CenterAndExpand,
	  };

	  var aboutButton = new Button {
		Text = "About Us"
	  };

	  var signupButton = new Button {
	    Text = "Signup"
	  };

	  // Here we are implementing a click event using lambda expressions
	  // when a user clicks the `aboutButton` they will navigate to the
	  // About Us page.
	  aboutButton.Clicked += (object sender, EventArgs e) => {
	    Navigation.PushAsync(new AboutPage());
	  };

	  // Navigation to the Signup Page (Note: We haven't created this page yet)
	  signupButton.Clicked += (object sender, EventArgs e) => {
		Navigation.PushAsync(new SignupPage());
	  };

	  var email = new Entry {
		Placeholder = "E-Mail",
	  };

	  var password = new Entry {
		Placeholder = "Password",
		IsPassword = true
	  };

	  var login = new Button {
		Text = "Login"
	  };

	  // With the `PushModalAsync` method we navigate the user
	  // the the orders page and do not give them an option to
	  // navigate back to the Homepage by clicking the back button
	  login.Clicked += (sender, e) => {
		Navigation.PushModalAsync(new OrdersPage());
	  };

	  Content = new StackLayout {
		Padding = 30,
		Spacing = 10,
		Children = {title, email, password, login, signupButton, aboutButton}
	  };
	}
  }
}
```

We're getting there! Let's go back to the `CloudCakes.cs` file and set the MainPage to our newly created homepage. For the navigation to work, we will additionally need to wrap the ContentPage with a NavigationPage class which will allow us to perform native navigation. The code should look like `MainPage = new NavigationPage(new HomePage());`. If all went according to plan, you should be able to launch the simulator and navigate to the About Us page, Signup page and Orders page.

![CloudCakes Homepage](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/xamarin/cloudcakes-home-page.png)

> We purposefully built our UI backwards so that we could introduce the different Xamarin.Forms elements in smaller chunks.

## Aside: Xamarin Authentication with Auth0

With the UI and navigation in place we are ready to add the login and signup functionality to our application. We will use Auth0's [RESTful Authentication API](https://auth0.com/docs/auth-api) to authenticate and create new users. Additionally, we will use the **RestSharp** and **Newtonsoft JSON** libraries to interface with the API easier. As we won't be using a datastore for this simple demo, we will store the user credentials in the `Application.Current` namespace so that we can access the user data throughout our application. You are not required to use Auth0 for Xamarin authentication. We've used the Auth0 REST API for brevity but if you are interested in building your own check out this great [example](https://github.com/auth0/nodejs-jwt-authentication-sample) on how you could implement JWT authentication with NodeJS.

First we will implement the login functionality. When a user enters their **Email** and **Password**, we will send this data to the Auth0 `oauth/ro` API endpoint which will validate the credentials and if successful return a `id_token` and `access_token` which we will use to get the user data. If we do not get an `access_token` back we will let the user know that they have entered invalid credentials.

```
using System;
using Xamarin.Forms;
using RestSharp;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace CloudCakes
{
  public class HomePage : ContentPage
  {
	public HomePage ()
	{

      // We have ommitted code we already went over

	  var login = new Button {
		Text = "Login"
	  };

	  login.Clicked += (sender, e) => {
		// We implemented a login function that accepts
		// two strings, the first being the users email
		// and the send the users password. We get this
		// data from the entry forms we created earlier
	    Login(email.Text, password.Text);
	  };
	}

    // The Login function makes a call to the Auth0 REST API
    // and attempts to authenticate the user.
	public void Login(string username, string password){
	  // We are using the RestSharp library which provides many useful
	  // methods and helpers when dealing with REST.
	  // We first create the request and add the necessary parameters
	  var client = new RestClient("https://{YOUR-AUTH0-DOMAIN}.auth0.com");
	  var request = new RestRequest("oauth/ro", Method.POST);
	  request.AddParameter("client_id", "{YOUR-AUTH0-CLIENT-ID");
	  request.AddParameter("username", username);
	  request.AddParameter("password", password);
	  request.AddParameter("connection", "{YOUR-CONNECTION-NAME-FOR-USERNAME-PASSWORD-AUTH}");
	  request.AddParameter("grant_type", "password");
	  request.AddParameter("scope","openid");

      // We execute the request and capture the response
      // in a variable called `response`
	  IRestResponse response = client.Execute(request);

      // Using the Newtonsoft.Json library we deserialaize the string into an object,
      // we have created a LoginToken class that will capture the keys we need
	  LoginToken token = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<LoginToken> (response.Content);

	  // We check to see if we received an `id_token` and if we did make a secondary call
	  // to get the user data. If we did not receive an `id_token` we can safely assume
	  // that the authentication failed so we display an error message telling the user
	  // to try again.
	  if (token.id_token != null) {
		Application.Current.Properties ["id_token"] = token.id_token;
        Application.Current.Properties ["access_token"] = token.access_token;
		GetUserData (token.id_token);
	  } else {
		DisplayAlert ("Oh No!", "It's seems that you have entered an incorrect email or password. Please try again.", "OK");
	  };
	}

    // If we did get an `id_token` we make a secondary call to the Auth0 REST API
    // This time we call the `tokeninfo` endpoint which requires an `id_token`
    // The endpoint then verifies the token is valid and returns user data.
	public void GetUserData(string token){
	  var client = new RestClient("https://{YOUR-AUTH0-DOMAIN}.auth0.com");
	  var request = new RestRequest("tokeninfo", Method.GET);
	  request.AddParameter ("id_token", token);


	  IRestResponse response = client.Execute (request);

	  User user = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<User> (response.Content);

	  // Once the call executes, we capture the user data in the
	  // `Application.Current` namespace which is globally available in Xamarin
	  Application.Current.Properties ["email"] = user.email;
	  Application.Current.Properties ["picture"] = user.picture;

	  // Finally, we navigate the user the the Orders page
	  Navigation.PushModalAsync (new OrdersPage ());
	}

	public class LoginToken{
	  public string id_token { get; set; }
	  public string access_token {get; set;}
	  public string token_type { get; set; }
	}

	public class User {
	  public string name { get; set;}
	  public string picture { get; set;}
	  public string email { get; set; }
	}
  }
}
```

Now that we have our login functionality in place - let's go back to the orders page and update the `user` object to use real data. Open up the OrdersPage.cs file and make the following adjustments:

```
User user = new User {
  Email = Application.Current.Properties["email"] as string,
  Avatar = Application.Current.Properties["picture"] as string
};
```

Now when a user logs in and is redirected to the Orders page, they will see their email and avatar instead of the static placeholder we had initially setup. Let's build our solution and launch the simulator. Let's first try to login with invalid credentials to ensure that we get the correct error message. Next, login with a real account and you should be taken to the orders page.

### Sign Up

In our last topic on Xamarin authentication, let's allow users to signup for a CloudCakes account. Here, we will utilize the `dbconnections/signup` Auth0 API endpoint and pass the credentials the user will authenticate with. Let's see the implementation in code:

```

using System;
using Xamarin.Forms;
using RestSharp;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace CloudCakes
{
  public class SignupPage : ContentPage
  {
	public SignupPage ()
	{

With this code implemented, let's build and launch the iOS simulator then navigate to the signup page. Let's first create a new account so that we can observe the success state. Now, let's try to recreate that same account, and observe the failure state. Finally, navigate back to the homepage and login with your newly created account. If all went well - you should be navigated to the Orders page and be able to place an order!

## Putting It All Together

We've written a lot of code today. Up until now, we have been testing everything using the iOS simulator - so we know our app runs well in iOS. Since we're building a cross-platform app, let's build and deploy our solution for Android. The easiest way to accomplish this is to right click on the **CloudCakes.Droid** directory, navigate to **Run With**, and select **XamarinAndroid&&API&&15 (API 15)**. This will compile the app for Android and run it in the Android Emulator. It may take a few minutes for everything to compile but once ready the CloudCakes app will open in the Android Emulator.

Since we've written all of our code in the shared CloudCakes directory, our application will function exactly as it did in the iOS simulator. To test, navigate to the About Us page, go back and navigate to the signup page, create a new account, login and place an order. You should see the exact results as you did with the iOS simulator. The only difference is that instead of the native iOS UI, you see the app in the native Android UI, and since we targeted SDK 15, you see the app in the **Holo** design specification.

Today, we were able to build a cross-platform app that works on both Android and iOS. The app adopted the design language of it's target platform and behaved as a native app. The end user would not be able to tell that our app was built with C# instead of Objective-C or Java. Furthermore, we've impelemented Xamarin authentication with the Auth0 RESTful API which gave us total control of the UI. Xamarin allowed us to build the app without knowing how the Android or iOS runtime worked and showcased how hybrid app development may be viable option for your apps.

To close out the tutorial, we've created an infographic that highlights the strengths of native, hybrid and responsive web development. Native and responsive web have clear strengths and weaknesses while hybrid app development seems to be the best of both worlds. A word of caution though, the popular phrase *"jack of all trades, master of none"* tends to apply to hybrid apps so consider all of your requirements before selecting a platform to build your mobile applications on.
