The annual [CakeFest](https://cakefest.org) conference is upon us again. A lot of people are excited about the various talks that are lined up. You can find the [schedule](https://cakefest.org/schedule) on the CakeFest website, where all the talks are listed.

In today's article, I'll recap all the talks that happened and the announcements coming out of CakeFest 2017.

**Larry Masters** opened the conference with his keynote.

**[Prosper Otemuyiwa](https://twitter.com/unicodeveloper)** talked about **Progressive Web Apps for CakePHP developers**. Yeah, that's me. I spoke about how CakePHP developers can latch on to Progressive Web Apps technology to build web apps that behave like mobile apps and works well across many browsers. I encouraged the developers present at the conference to learn JavaScript and take advantage of its power.
