[OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) final specs 1.0 were [published today](http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/26/openid-foundation-launches-openid-connect-identity-protocol-with-support-from-google-microsoft-others/)! This is a milestone for the identity community and we are happy to have been part of its development.

When we started writing the core functionality of [Auth0](https://auth0.com), we had to decide which authentication protocols we were going to support. Back then, there were **WS-Federation**, **SAML**, and **OAuth2**. This last one was being widely adopted by companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc.

<!-- more -->

The key advantages of OAuth2 are its simplicity (compared to SAML for example), and the wide availability of libraries already written in different languages and platforms. However, [OAuth2 is not an authentication protocol](http://www.thread-safe.com/2012/01/problem-with-oauth-for-authentication.html). We started looking at options for our defualt authentication protocol and we've found [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect) which was promising to do exactly what we envisioned was needed.

I was fortunate to be personally involved from the beginning. My main concern always being, keeping things as simple as possible. Many thanks to [Mike Jones](http://self-issued.info) for inviting me to join the working group!

### So what it's OpenID Connect?

**The OpenId Connect core spec is OAuth2 + JSON Web Tokens**. Of course it has more than that (session management, dynamic client registration and others), but the core is simple. By having a signed token we can validate that the user is being authenticated to the right application coming from the right identity provider (avoiding the [confused deputy problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem)). That token can also be used to flow the identity of the user to an API, very useful in native mobile and single page applications, as we touched on our [Cookies vs. Tokens article]({{ site.baseurl }}/2014/01/07/angularjs-authentication-with-cookies-vs-token/).

JWT popularity is growing every day. Here are some Open Source libraries yuo can use to get started:

* **Node.js**
  * [github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken)
* **Ruby**
  * [github.com/progrium/ruby-jwt](https://github.com/progrium/ruby-jwt)
* **C#**
  * [nuget.org/packages/System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt/)
  * [github.com/johnsheehan/jwt](https://github.com/johnsheehan/jwt)
* **ASP.NET Web Api**
  * [github.com/auth0/webapi-jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/webapi-jsonwebtoken)
* **ASP.NET (Owin)**
  * [nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Owin.Security.Jwt](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Owin.Security.Jwt)
  * [github.com/michaelnoonan/Auth0-Owin-JwtBearerAuthentication](https://github.com/michaelnoonan/Auth0-Owin-JwtBearerAuthentication)
* **Java**
