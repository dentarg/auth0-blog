## Hack the Auth0 Code and Win a $5,000 Amazon Gift Card

Are you headed to [Identiverse 2018](https://identiverse.com/) (formerly Cloud Identity Summit) in Boston this June? If so, you’ll have a chance to **win a $5,000 Amazon Gift Card** when you drop by Auth0 Booth **(#200)**.

We’re so excited about Identiverse that we’re bringing the Auth0 safe with that $5,000 Amazon Gift Card inside. Visit our booth for your chance to “Hack the Code.” We welcome schemes and strategies, but you’ll get only one chance to crack the 4-digit code each day until the code is cracked. The winner will take home that $5,000 Amazon Gift Card + an Auth0 t-shirt and tote. (But even if you don’t hack the code, you’ll **still** get an Auth0 t-shirt and tote.)
