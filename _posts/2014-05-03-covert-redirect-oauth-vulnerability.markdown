**TL;DR**:

* **If you use Auth0 you are not vulnerable to this attack.**
* This attack is __not new__.
* It would only affect your application if it connects with OAuth providers that __don't__ perform FULL `redirect_uri` checks (e.g. Facebook).
* For you to be vulnerable, your web site needs to have an endpoint that blindly redirects the browser to whatever URL including all its parameters.

## Tell me moreâ€¦

Here is a [longer and deeper description of the issue](http://dannythorpe.com/2014/05/02/tech-analysis-of-serious-security-flaw-in-oauth-openid-discovered/).

## How we addressed this issue?

As [we did with Heartbleed](https://auth0.com/blog/2014/04/08/our-response-to-heartbleed/) a month ago, we acted inmediately. The moment this hit the news we got in touch with the security experts from [Sakurity](http://sakurity.com), the consulting company we hired to audit our platform. We've been working very closely with [Egor Homakov](https://twitter.com/homakov) and his team on a weekly basis. Egor is a trusted and well known security consultant who has found vulnerabilities on several OAuth providers. The moment this vulnerability was reported he re-assessed [Auth0](https://auth0.com) and found we were not vulnerable to this attack, because we don't have open redirectors on the server. Egor published about this on [his blog](http://homakov.blogspot.com/2014/05/covert-redirect-faq.html)

It is worth mentioning that Egor had warned us all about this vulnerability [a year ago](http://homakov.blogspot.com.ar/2013/02/hacking-facebook-with-oauth2-and-chrome.html).
