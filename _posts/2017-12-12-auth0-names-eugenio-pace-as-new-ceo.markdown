**BELLEVUE, WA -- Dec. 12, 2017** – Auth0, a global leader in Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), today announced that company co-founder Eugenio Pace will serve as its new chief executive officer, effective immediately. The company is grateful to Jon Gelsey, Auth0’s former CEO, for four years of outstanding service.

Pace has been integral to Auth0’s exponential growth since co-founding the company with Matias Woloski, CTO, in 2013. Most recently as chief customer officer, Pace has been part of the leadership team that has led to Auth0’s significant milestones, such as raising nearly $55M in total funding-to-date, and in 2017 alone:

* Doubling its customer base with 1,500 new companies;
* Increasing revenues by more than 100 percent; 
* Hiring more than 120 new people; and
* Opening offices in London, Tokyo, and Sydney.

With an extensive technical background and previous senior management positions at Microsoft, Pace will focus his efforts on continued product innovation, customer success, and global expansion. 


“I’m honored to be at the helm of Auth0 at such an exciting stage in the company’s evolution. The past few years of exceptional growth are a strong indicator of where we are heading, and I am very appreciative of Jon’s dedication to getting us to this stage,” said Pace. “We hold steadfast to our mission of providing the easiest-to-use IDaaS platform to solve the most complex and large-scale identity and access management challenges. Our amazing team has enabled us to stake our leadership claim in this market, and I’m thrilled to continue our mission as leader of this organization.”
