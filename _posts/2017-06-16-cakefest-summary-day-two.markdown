**[Mark Story](https://twitter.com/mark_story)** talked about **CakePHP 3.4 And The Path To 4.0.0**. He talked about the team working towards typehinting and splitting modal methods in *3.2.x* to *3.4.x*. He mentioned that in *4.0* there would be PHP 7.1 support, support will be dropped for PHP 5, strict typehinting, and deprecation cleanup. His session reveals so many things about how CakePHP has transformed over the years and what the public should expect to see in future releases.
