Since we released the beta, one of the things our customers have been telling us, is they want us to support a "username/password" authentication. Auth0 is being used today by two different audiences:

<!-- more -->

-   **Cloud apps**: they want to have a single uniform authentication and login analytics, across all the options: social providers, enterprise providers (like Google Apps or Active Directory, SAML Providers) and now, username and password.

-   **Organizations**: our enterprise customers, typically have already a dozen (sometimes more) of "identity silos" created for different apps, at different times and they want to consolidate those databases.

### Enter Database Connections

Database Connections works exactly like "Custom Connections" but with some advantages:

-   you don't have to deploy another application
-   seamless widget integration
-   a whole set of templates for your needs
-   develop, try and debug in the cloud without needing to install any tool

### Example: ASP.NET Membership Provider

Suppose we have already started to build a product using the standard [ASP.NET Membership Provider](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yh26yfzy.aspx). ASP.NET Membership autogenerates a set of tables and relationships in Sql Server as shown here:

![](http://blog.auth0.com.s3.amazonaws.com/A4N95VJO07-1200x1200.jpeg)

We would start by creating a new Database Connection in Auth0. Then we can pick the ASP.NET Membership Provider from the list:

We can tweak the script to fit our needs:

Connection strings and passwords should be stored as configuration settings in the bottom pane:

We can open at anytime the Try window to run our script:

In order to debug the script you can take advantage of `console.log`:

When the login is succesful you will see a green border and the result profile:

After we have finished the script, the login widget in our site will look like this:
