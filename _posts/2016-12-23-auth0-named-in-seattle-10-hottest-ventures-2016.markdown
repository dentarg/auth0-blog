**BELLEVUE, WA** - Every year the [*Seattle Museum of History and Industry*](http://www.mohai.org/) partners with [*GeekWire*](http://www.geekwire.com/) to present the [*Seattle 10*](http://www.mohai.org/component/content/article/70-exhibits/764-seattle-10) - a collection of ten history-making local start-up companies. Auth0 had the privilege of joining the [Seattle 10 Class of 2016](http://www.geekwire.com/2016/meet-seattle-10-hot-startups-transforming-everything-education-enterprise-software/), chosen over dozens of other fantastic nominees. To commemorate, Auth0 and the other winners recreated their business ideas on a six-foot by six-foot cocktail napkin that was unveiled on December 7 at the GeekWire Gala. The pop-up exhibit will run through January 29, 2017.
