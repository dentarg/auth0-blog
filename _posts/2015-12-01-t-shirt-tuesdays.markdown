This has been a great year for us here at Auth0, with lots of awesome achievements: we launched two new regions (one in the [EU](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/04/27/auth0-europe-launches/), and one in [AU](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/09/21/auth0-australia-launches/)) to offer the lowest possible login latency to all of our global subscribers; we‚Äôve updated our pricing, including the introduction of a new, free plan with up to 7000 active users, to make Auth0 more accessible for many different use-cases, and so much more. Don‚Äôt worry, though - we‚Äôll still be working hard into 2016 and beyond to continue to make identity implementation and management easier and more secure!

But, back to the free t-shirt thing! Because you, our amazing Auth0 fans and subscribers, have shared feedback and cheered us on throughout the year, we want to give back some of that love we‚Äôve been so happy to have received. For that reason, we‚Äôre giving away 100 t-shirts throughout the month of December!

{% include tweet_quote.html quote_text="We‚Äôre giving away 100 t-shirts throughout the month of December!" %}

It‚Äôs simple: help us spread the word about your favorite Auth0 features, and get a free t-Shirt delivered straight to your front door! üëï

Every Tuesday in December (that‚Äôs the next 5 weeks!), we‚Äôll be hosting T-Shirt Tuesday, where we will give away 20 Auth0 t-shirts each day. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/auth0), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/getauth0), and [Quora](https://www.quora.com/topic/Auth0-Inc) for your chance to win. All you have to do is post about your favorite Auth0 feature (MFA? SSO? So many choices!), using the hashtag #Auth0FTW and we‚Äôll ship a t-shirt to the first 20 respondents. We‚Äôll be on Twitter on December 1st and 29th, Facebook on December 8th and 22nd, and Quora on December 15th. We hope to hear from you! And,thanks for being so awesome!

Here‚Äôs the full schedule so you don‚Äôt miss anything!
