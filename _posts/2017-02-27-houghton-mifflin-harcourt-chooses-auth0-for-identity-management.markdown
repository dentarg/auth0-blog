**BELLEVUE, WA** - [Houghton Mifflin Harcourt](http://www.hmhco.com/) (HMH), a global learning company specializing in pre-K-12 education content and services, has chosen Auth0 as their identity management platform for their new educational portal. The new portal allows school districts across the United States and the world to access content and technology through a unified experience.

Being a global organization with many unique technologies, data stores, and customers to serve, HMH needed a solution that would allow them to consolidate everything through a single unified experience while allowing existing customers to access this new platform through their existing identity. Auth0 stepped up to challenge and delivered a solution that did just that. Existing customers could log in with their established identities while new customers and users could easily be onboarded.

Performance was a key consideration for HMH. The company has to deal with large changing user sets and enrollment data, especially right before the school year begins. Auth0 was able to demonstrate exceptional performance with their bulk loader for managing large data sets as well as the platforms capability to handle over 1 billion authentication transactions per day.

The company makes it easy for developers to implement even the most complex identity solutions for their web, mobile, and internal applications.
