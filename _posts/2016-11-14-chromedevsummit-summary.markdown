The Chrome Developer Summit 2016 consisted of about 19 talks and some workshops.  More people attended the summit than expected. The talks and workshops were really awesome. This year, the Chrome Developer Summit majorly focused on making the web better and more accessible with Progressive Web Apps. A lot of the talks and workshops were centered around understanding the nitty-gritty of progressive enhancements, improvement in web apps performance and pushing the mobile web forward in ways that make it more native-like. According to *VP, Chrome Engineering*, [Darin Fisher](https://twitter.com/darinwf) who gave the keynote, there are currently about 2 billion active Chrome browsers across mobile and desktop.

**[Thao Tran](https://twitter.com/thaotran)** presented the first talk of the summit. Her talk was on *Building Progressive Web Apps Today*. She shared some success stories about platforms that have experienced increased conversion rates and sales because they built progressive web apps for their websites. Platforms such as [flipkart.com](https://www.flipkart.com/) and [housing.com](https://housing.com). Check out the session [here](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/schedule/sessions/building-progressive-web-apps-today).

**[Zack Kosh](https://twitter.com/zachk)**, Product Manager, Chrome talked about to make users experience faster web payments with the new Web Payment API. The API will help developers build a seamless, easy-to-use checkout experience. He also laid strong emphasis on the fact that they are not trying to become a processor/gateway like Stripe and Braintree. The Web Payments API is in it's early stages, so expect a whole lot more. Check out the session [here](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/schedule/sessions/web-payments).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Payment Request API gets me so hyped.

**[Paul Irish](https://twitter.com/paul_irish)** gave a talk on *Debugging the Web*. He demoed some of the interesting works that the DevTools team of the Chrome project have been working on. Several small improvements have been made to the Chrome DevTools to give the developer more power to easily debug JavaScript applications. One of the very small improvements I really liked was getting rid of having to use "Shift + Enter" to move the next line when writing code in the console. Now, you can just hit "Enter" after an opening brace and Chrome automatically understands that you aren't done coding yet. With a closing brace, it picks up the signal that you are done coding, then it proceeds to running the code. Other small improvements can be seen in his session [here](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/schedule/sessions/debugging-the-web)

**[Taylor Savage](https://twitter.com/taylorthesavage)** and **[Monica Dinculescu](https://notwaldorf)** talked about [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) and Web Components. They talked about how several browsers now support Shadow DOM and Custom elements. Taylor highlighted organizations that use Polymer actively. Companies like *BBVA*, *Coca-cola*, *EA*, *Predix* and *Google*. Want to learn how to use Polymer? Check out this [excellent tutorial](https://auth0.com/blog/build-your-first-app-with-polymer-and-web-components/) to get started. In addition, check out their session [here](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/schedule/sessions/web-components-and-polymer).

**[Alex Russell](https://twitter.com/slightlylate)**, Software Engineer, Chrome gave a talk on *Progressive Performance*. He was really passionate about testing apps performance on slow networks and low-power devices. Alex admonished developers not to assume that their high-end devices are used extensively by the general populace. After testing on the browser with the available online tools, he stated that developers should still strive to test on real devices because cases such as network and cpu throttling can be accurately measured there. He also stated that *53% of visits are abandoned if a mobile site takes more than three seconds to load.*  Check out his session [here](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/schedule/sessions/progressive-performance).

**[Sam Saccone](https://twitter.com/samccone)** gave a talk on *Planning for Performance*. Sam showed the developers present how to build super fast mobile web experiences. He said *Mobile web is no longer a subset of the web. It's simply the web!*. He highlighted the following for **Network Takeaways**:

- Preload is good for moving the start download time of an asset closer to the initial request
- H2 Push is good for cutting out a full RTT

**[Paul Bakaus](https://twitter.com/pbakaus)**, Developer Advocate, Google gave a talk on *From AMP to PWA - the best of both worlds*. He stated that *53% of users bounce from sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load*. He talked about the benefits of using **Accelerated Mobile Pages(AMP)**. The [AMP project](https://www.ampproject.org/) is an open-source JS library that:

* Defines behaviours for custom elements
* Manages rendering and resource loading to optimize performance
* Same everywhere - Highly cacheable

Check out his session [here](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/schedule/sessions/from-amp-to-pwa).

**[Sabine Borsay](https://twitter.com/saliiine) and [Eiji Kitamura](https://twitter.com/agektmr)**, gave a talk on *Sign-in on the Web - Credential Management and Best Practices*. They explained how the Credential Management API makes frictionless sign-in possible. Sabine quoted that according to a study, *92% of users will leave a site instead of resetting login info*. The Credential Management API is a standards-based browser API that provides a programmatic interface between the site and the browser for seamless sign-in across devices. It's accessible from Chrome 51. Sabine also talked about the password-sync feature for Chrome called `Smart Lock for Passwords` which allows a seamless sign-in cross-platform experience between your web and mobile app.

Eiji [demoed](https://credential-management-sample.appspot.com) the Credential Management API in practice with a website called [Polymer Shop](https://shop.polymer-project.org/). In this demo, he showed how you can sign in to an application on a device via `Google Login`, switch devices, open up the web app on the new device and you automatically get signed-in! All these seamless authentication flow made possible by the power of the Credential Management API.

![Credential Management API Auth Flow](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/images/2016/04/credential-management-api/image02.png)

**Aside: Authenticating with Auth0**

The [Credential Management API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/04/credential-management-api) is very promising like I mentioned above. Now, the automatic sign-in  across devices works only with `Google Login`. With [Auth0 Lock](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock), you have access to [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders) such as *Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce*, amongst others, or enterprise identity systems like *Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider*. Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication through more traditional username/password databases.
* Add support for linking different user accounts with the same user.
* Support for generating signed Json Web Tokens to call your APIs and flow the user identity securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).

## Conclusion

The Chrome Dev Summit generally focused on building progressive web apps. It's very obvious that Google is making giant strides to make the web more accessible and also bringing some native app functionalities to the web. Thanks to *Jake Archibald* and *Paul Lewis* for entertaining developers throughout the event. I had lots of fun and `Aha` moments during the summit. Already looking forward to **#ChromeDevSummit2017** and the awesomeness it's hopefully going to bring with it!

If you were at the summit, let me know your `Aha` moments in the comment section. 😃
