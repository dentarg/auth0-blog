It has been estimated that we spend nearly [100,000 hours](https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Work-Maximizing-Psychological-Capital/dp/0470749466) of our entire lives at work. Day after day, year after year, we dedicate precious time (and lots of it) to something that, in an ideal world, provides a great deal of satisfaction and long-term fulfillment. Job satisfaction is a term that is thrown around a lot, and it’s clear that being happy at your job is a confluence of many different factors. Of course, compensation and benefits are key, but according to the [Society of Human Resource Management](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-surveys/Documents/2017-Employee-Job-Satisfaction-and-Engagement-Executive-Summary.pdf), ‘respectful treatment of all employees at all levels’ ranks even higher than that as a key indicator of long-term job satisfaction. 

Respect, more specifically, ‘intense mutual respect’ is one of the key tenets we have made transparent as part of our [culture and values at Auth0](https://auth0.com/blog/our-culture-and-values-at-auth0/). The combination of these attributes is something we’re very proud of because it makes us who we are as a company. We are deeply committed to upholding these, whether we are a company of 500, 5,000, or 50,000 employees. 

While all Auth0 employees subscribe to these values and hold them dear, it’s always nice to be recognized by external sources for the job environment we have built from the ground up. Hired, a leading online marketplace that gives people more control over their career decisions, recently released its [**2017 Global Brand Health Report**](https://hired.com/blog/highlights/hired-brand-health-report-2017/) in which Auth0 is ranked as one of Seattle’s top 10 strongest employer brands. 

The survey of more than 2,300 tech workers identifies workplace attributes that are most desirable and shape the kinds of companies where people would love to work. Hired’s exclusive pool of qualified tech talent in areas such software engineering, product management, design, and data science, found these factors to be the ones they greatly value:

With U.S. headquarters in the Seattle area, Auth0 made the list alongside tech titans like Amazon, Microsoft, and Zillow, but our globally-distributed workforce and the ability for a large population of our employees to [work remotely](https://auth0.com/blog/21-tips-for-remote-working/) is another hugely attractive attribute for top talent. 

The survey, which identifies the highest-rated employer brands overall, as well as in major cities, has gotten coverage in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2017/10/27/the-tech-companies-people-want-to-work-for-most/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-26/spacex-google-top-list-of-companies-techies-want-to-work-for), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/27/survey-says-tech-talent-wants-to-work-at-spacex-google-and-shopify.html), and other national outlets. Not only does this recognition promote our great culture at Auth0, but drives our recruiting engine (we’re hiring, by the way!), and fuels the stellar level of talent that’s a prerequisite for becoming part of our company. 

We are continuing to drive our rapid growth with an expanded [senior leadership team](https://auth0.com/blog/auth0-expands-leadership-team/), new global offices, and an infrastructure that will scale with our expansion. But regardless of how quickly we grow, our culture is always going to be a top priority. 

If you think you’re a fit for our company, please check out our [job openings](https://auth0.com/jobs#job-openings) and get in touch. In addition, we have community initiatives and are always looking for people who are interested in contributing via our [Guest Author](https://auth0.com/guest-authors) and [Auth0 Ambassador](https://auth0.com/ambassador-program) programs. In the spirit of transparency, we also have many open-source libraries that welcome contributors, such as [auth0.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js), [Lock](https://github.com/auth0/lock), and [more in our GitHub](https://github.com/auth0).
