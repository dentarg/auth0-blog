Going to [//Build](http://www.buildwindows.com/) this week? [Dinesh Kulkarni](http://www.dineshk.net/) of Windows Azure Mobile Services fame was kind enough to invite us to his session: [__Who’s that user? Identity in Mobile Service__](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-544).

We will cover all things identity in Azure Mobile Services: from how to use standard identity providers supported out of the box, to building your own. I will show how you can connect a Mobile Services App to Auth0, and outsource authentication to anything: Active Directory, Azure Active Directory, Office 365, Google Apps, etc.

Session is on Friday 28th, 2PM, South Hall, East Mezzanine room 202. See you there!
