  **BELLEVUE, Wash. -- May 5, 2018** -- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), a global leader in Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), announced that renowned identity expert [Vittorio Bertocci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vittoriobertocci/) will be joining the company as Principal Architect. Bertocci will apply his vast knowledge of the identity industry to Auth0 in all aspects of the company, including internal and external education, product innovation, and customer integration. 

Bertocci has spent most of his 20-year career at Microsoft, where he worked on the Azure Active Directory team and focused largely on improving the developer experience. As a published author of four identity books and a highly-trafficked blog: [cloudidentity.com](http://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/), his forward-thinking commentary has enabled him to speak at conferences, such as BUILD, PDC, TechEd, Cloud Identity Summit, and many other industry events around the world. 

“I have followed the success of Auth0 since its inception and am very impressed with where it has been and where it is going,” said Bertocci. “I am thrilled to be joining the company and look forward to collaborating with the team to help continue its massive growth.” 

Bertocci holds a masters degree in Computer Science from Università degli Studi di Genova and began his career doing research on computational geometry and scientific visualization. Over the years, he has worked with Fortune 100 and Global 100 companies and has been a sought-after evangelist for claims-based identity in mainstream use. 

“My co-founder Matias Woloski and I knew Vittorio before we even started Auth0, and credit him with introducing us to many innovative identity concepts,” said Eugenio Pace, CEO and Co-founder of Auth0. “His highly technical expertise and deep knowledge of the industry as a whole will be an incredible resource for Auth0.”
