Just a few years ago, some retailers were hesitant about letting shoppers access online stores through social logins like Facebook or Google. Leading up to [Shoptalk 2018](https://shoptalk.com/), people headed to this year’s global retail innovation convention in Vegas are telling us that’s no longer the case — [one-click login](https://auth0.com/retail) has gone mainstream.

## Increased Conversions
At Auth0, we’ve helped customers like Polaris, Nando’s, Wayfair, The Iconic, Western Digital, Talbot’s, and more streamline their customer logins. Our customers find that social login increases conversions, removing unnecessary barriers to a pleasurable shopping experience. 

Rather than losing a customer during login hesitation, social login also gives retailers opportunities for personalization while enabling them to deliver a consistent brand experience at each touchpoint. According to a [Web Hosting Buzz survey](http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/blog/2013/03/21/whos-sharing-what/): 86% of users report being bothered by having to create new accounts on websites. 

## Phase I Replatforming - Identity

Another trend we’re hearing is the desire to replatform ecommerce experiences as a way to become more responsive to ever-changing customer needs. Shoptalk attendees are telling us that addressing identity is phase I in their multi-phase approach to becoming more agile.

Auth0 identity offers an opportunity to create a true omnichannel experience across brands with single-sign on, while also simplifying partner collaborations.

## Schedule Your Shoptalk Meeting with Auth0

We are sending an expert team, including a software architect, to Shoptalk this year. If you’d like to schedule a meeting to discuss how Auth0 can help increase your conversions, personalize engagement, streamline partnerships, and build brand loyalty, please reach out to [sales@auth0.com](mailto:sales@auth0.com).
