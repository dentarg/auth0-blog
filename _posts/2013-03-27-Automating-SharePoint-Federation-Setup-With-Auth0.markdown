Supporting SharePoint is a prime scenario in Auth0 and it's fully integrated into it. In [this post](http://blog.auth0.com/2013/03/04/On-Premises-SharePoint-Federated-with-Office-365-and-Google/) we show how SharePoint can accept users authenticated in Google and Office365. In [this other one](http://blog.auth0.com/2013/03/07/On-Premises-SharePoint-Federated-with-Partner-AD/) we do the same with a partner using Active Directory.

In this post, we show how easy it is to **configure** SharePoint for claims based authentication.

<!-- more -->

We have fully integrated the experience into Auth0 control panel so setup is as simple as:

-1. Entering your SharePoint URL
-2. Running the PowerShell scripts we generate for you on your SharePoint box

And that's it!

Another example of our "just works" approach to identity management in Auth0.
