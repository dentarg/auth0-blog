**BELLEVUE, WA - NOVEMBER 8, 2017**  - Auth0, the global leader in Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), today announced its inclusion in a list of Seattle's top ten employer brands from career marketplace Hired. [The 2017 Global Brand Health Report](https://hired.com/blog/highlights/hired-brand-health-report-2017/) is based on overall workplace attributes that more than 2,300 tech employees and jobseekers value. Listed alongside [Amazon](https://amazon.com), [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/), and [Costco](https://www.costco.com/), **[Auth0](https://auth0.com)** was included in the top 10 for its stellar compensation and benefits, company culture, team, opportunity to learn new skills, and more. 

Auth0’s U.S. headquarters are in Bellevue, WA, with additional offices in Buenos Aires, London, and Sydney. With a commitment to building a global workforce, the company offers the option to work remotely, which is embraced by existing employees, and recommended by Hired as a way to attract premium candidates. The combination of Auth0’s generous benefits and workplace attributes make it a place people would ‘love to work.’ 

“As a company that puts great emphasis on our culture and values, we are thrilled to be recognized as one of the best employer brands in Seattle,” said Kendal Callison, VP of People. “Our many benefits, including unlimited vacation time, continue to attract the best global tech talent, and we are dedicated to upholding these as we continue our rapid growth.”
