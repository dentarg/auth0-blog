**TL;DR** Whether you're a small consultancy working with a few clients or have been around for some time, the authentication needs of your customers are likely similar. Legacy authentication via username and password is not enough. Your customers are demanding multifactor authentication, single sign-on, and greater security. Building these features in-house is complex, but with Auth0 it doesn't have to be.

Being a consultant or systems integrator means wearing many hats. To be successful you must be knowledgeable about various technologies, methodologies, and best practices as well as know how to put them all together to meet your clients' goals. The technological landscape is constantly changing and keeping up can be a challenge.

When it comes to authentication and security, usernames and passwords are simply not enough. Modern authentication focuses on:

* [Managing user identity](https://auth0.com/docs/user-profile)
* [Top tier security and availability](https://auth0.com/security)
* [Multiple authentication strategies](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders)
* [Multifactor authentication](https://auth0.com/docs/multifactor-authentication)
* [Single sign-on](https://auth0.com/docs/sso)
* [Passwordless authentication](https://auth0.com/passwordless)
* and more...

*Keeping up* with modern authentication and security best practices would be challenging on its own, but *implementing* it alone would require a herculean level of effort.  At Auth0, we can provide your consulting organization with the tools and support to implement modern authentication for your clients.

## Auth0 for Systems Integrators

Whether you're a small consultancy working with a few clients or have been around for some time, the authentication requirements from your customers are likely similar. Auth0 can provide a comprehensive authentication platform that your clients will love. Your organization will benefit from being able to provide modern authentication in record time. Let's take a look at some of the features.

### Modern Authentication

Authentication starts at the login screen. The [Lock](https://auth0.com/lock) widget provides a modern login widget that supports traditional username and password, social, and enterprise authentication. This cross-platform widget can be implemented in as little as ten lines of code but supports various branding and configuration options to truly make it your own. If you prefer to implement your own unique UI instead, our RESTful API provides the same functionality so you can have full control.

### Enterprise Federation and Single Sign-On

Enterprises require governance over their users and will demand [single sign-on](https://auth0.com/docs/sso). Implementing and maintaining integrations with the various [enterprise federation providers](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders#enterprise) would be a very challenging task. Auth0 has built integrations with leading platforms like [Active Directory](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/enterprise/active-directory), [Ping](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/saml/identity-providers/ping7), [ADFS](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/enterprise/adfs), [LDAP](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/enterprise/active-directory), [SAML](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/saml/saml-configuration) and more so all you have to do is provide the configuration details and we'll take care of the rest.

### Social Connections

Allowing users to log in with their existing social accounts can increase conversion rates and improve the user experience. Auth0 supports [over thirty social connection](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders) providers including [Facebook](https://facebook.com), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com), and [Google](https://google.com). Auth0 can additionally be integrated into any provider that supports [OAuth 2](https://auth0.com/docs/extensions/custom-social-extensions).

### Traditional Authentication with Enhanced Security Features

If [username and password](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database) authentication is a requirement, Auth0 has you covered. Traditional **username and password** or **email and password** authentication is provided with enhanced security features. [**Multifactor authentication**](https://auth0.com/docs/multifactor-authentication) greatly enhances the security of this type of authentication and can be added with the flip of a switch. Anomaly detection, which prevents brute force attacks, as well as [breached password detection](https://auth0.com/breached-passwords) go a step further to provide greater security for your users.

### Passwordless Authentication

[Passwordless authentication](https://auth0.com/passwordless) allows your users to log in without having to enter or remember a password. Instead, when the user wants to log in, they provide their email address or phone number and receive a one time passcode that they use to authenticate instead. Auth0 provides various options for passwordless authentication including [TouchID](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock-ios/touchid-authentication).
