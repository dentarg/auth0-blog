**TL;DR:** In the JavaScript land, there are a plethora of libraries and frameworks. And new libraries and frameworks keep showing up almost every other week. On Tuesday, October 25 2016, a small JavaScript framework, **Next.js** was released to the public. It's a minimal framework for building server-rendered universal JavaScript web apps. In this article, I'll walk you through how to create a universal JavaScript web app with **Next.js**.

## What is a Universal JavaScript Application?

Every now and then, buzzwords pop up in the programming world and sometimes developers don't have a full grasp of these words. What is a Universal JavaScript app? What does the term *Universal* mean in this context?

The term *Universal* simply means the ability to run the same code on the server, browsers, mobile devices and any other platform. *Universal Javascript* is a term people are leaning towards these days. A lot of developers still call it **Isomorphic JavaScript**. In short, there is a debate on the [React repo](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/4041) about this term. Michael Jackson, a popular ReactJS developer wrote a blog post on [Universal JavaScript](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9#.ij2c0zh8j). It's indeed true that *naming things* is one of the most difficult aspects of Computer Science.

## Enter Next.js

**[Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/)** is a small framework that is built on top of React, Webpack and Babel. It was built to enable easy creation of server-rendered React applications. **Next.js** saves you time and effort because it ships with features out of the box that caters for server-rendering of JavaScript applications. These features include the following:

* Hot code reloading
* Automatic transpilation and bundling(using babel & webpack)
* Server rendering and indexing of JavaScript files in the `/pages` directory
* Serving of static files
* CSS isolation and modularization

**Next.js** makes good use of already written and well-tested modules from the JavaScript community. With **Next.js**, every component inside the **pages/** directory gets server-rendered automatically and their scripts inlined. Wow! is it that easy? Yes!!!

We'll be building a simple character-listing app with **Next.js 1.0.2**, just like we did with [Laravel](https://auth0.com/blog/creating-your-first-laravel-app-and-adding-authentication/).

## Our App: NexThrone

![NexThrone App](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/nexthrone.png)

We are building a very simple app today, it is called **NexThrone**. The NexThrone app displays a list of Game of Thrones' characters. It also provides a detailed information about each character when clicked upon. We'll see how **Next.js** makes it so easy for us to build this server-rendered JavaScript web application. **Next.js** does the heavy-lifting for us, while we focus on the application's core functionality! The full source code for the completed app can be [cloned at this GitHub repo](https://github.com/auth0-blog/nextjs-got).

## Setup and Installation

The official [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) documentation uses *npm*. We'll use [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn), just because it's faster and more effective. You haven't tried Yarn before? check out [5 things you can do with Yarn here](https://auth0.com/blog/five-things-you-can-do-with-yarn/).

Let's get started!

Create a new directory, cd into the directory and run this command below:

```bash
yarn init
```

![Yarn Init](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/yarnInit.png)
_Creating a package.json file_

Follow the instructions, also ensure that a `package.json` file was created in the end. Now, go ahead and install **Next.js** like so:

```bash
yarn add next
```

![Yarn next](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/yarnNext.png)
_Installing Next.js with Yarn_

Once `next.js` has finished installing, open up your `package.json` file and add a script to it like so:

```js

{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next"
  }
}
```

![Add Script to package.json](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/nextConfig.png)
_Add Script to package.json_

Go ahead and create a `pages` directory within the project. Add an `index.js` file to the `pages` directory like so:

```js

import React from 'react'
export default () => <div> Hello World!</div>
```

Now, run `yarn run dev` and go to http://localhost:3000. Your homepage should look like so:

![Hello World](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/helloWorld.png)
_Homepage_

![Yarn run dev](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/yarnRun.png)
_Run Next_

## Setting up Seed Data

We are dealing with the game of thrones' characters. So, we need their stage names, real names, bio and their avatars. Let's set up a file that contains such data.

Create a new `data` directory in your root folder, then add a `posts.js` file to it.

Open up the `posts.js` file and add this code to it like so:

_data/posts.js_

```js

const posts = [
   {
      "codeName":"Jon Snow",
      "realName":"Kit Harington",
      "id":"1161022966406956503",

   }
];

export default posts;
```

## Setting up the Index Page

We have an index page that displays *Hello World* to the screen. Let's change that! The index page should display a list of game of thrones' characters.

Open up your `index.js` file and this code to it like so:

_pages/index.js_

```js

import React from 'react'
import posts from '../data/posts'
import { style } from 'next/css'
import Link from 'next/link'

export default class extends React.Component {
  static getInitialProps () {
    return { posts: posts }
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <div>
      <div className={style(styles.header)}>
        <h3> NEXTHRONE - THE REVELATION OF GAME OF THRONES' CHARACTERS </h3>
      </div>
      <table className={style(styles.table)}>
        <thead>
          <tr>
              <th className={style(styles.th)}>Character</th>
              <th className={style(styles.th)}>Real Name</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {
              this.props.posts.map( (post, i) => (
                  <tr key={i}>
                      <td className={style(styles.td)}>{ post.codeName }</td>
                      <td className={style(styles.td)}>
                        <Link href={`/account?id=${post.id}`}>{ post.realName }</Link>
                      </td>
                  </tr>
              ))
          }
       </tbody>
      </table>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

const styles = {
  th: {
    background: '#00cccc',
    color: '#fff',
    textTransform: 'uppercase',
    fontSize: '12px',
    padding: '12px 35px',
  },

  header: {
    font: '15px Monaco',
    textAlign: 'center'
  },

  table: {
    fontFamily: 'Arial',
    margin: '25px auto',
    borderCollapse: 'collapse',
    border: '1px solid #eee',
    borderBottom: '2px solid #00cccc'
  },

  td: {
    color: '#999',
    border: '1px solid #eee',
    padding: '12px 35px',
    borderCollapse: 'collapse'
  },

  list: {
    padding: '50px',
    textAlign: 'center'
  },

  photo: {
    display: 'inline-block'
  },

  photoLink: {
    color: '#333',
    verticalAlign: 'middle',
    cursor: 'pointer',
    background: '#eee',
    display: 'inline-block',
    width: '250px',
    height: '250px',
    lineHeight: '250px',
    margin: '10px',
    border: '2px solid transparent',
    ':hover': {
      borderColor: 'blue'
    }
  }
}
```

Our Index page should look like this below:

![Index Page of NexThrone](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/nexthrone.png)
_NexThrone Index Page_

This is basically React code but there are some new imports from the `next` framework. Every route within **Next.js** is simply an ES6 module that exports a function or class that extends from React.Component. In `getInitialProps`, we are returning the posts array from the `posts.js` we created earlier as a `prop`.

We know that the React `render` method actually does the UI rendering. Within the `render` method, we looped through the posts `prop` to display the characters in a table.

The awesome thing about **Next.js** is that it automatically maps a `.js` file within the `pages` directory to a route. So basically,

* `pages/index.js` maps to `/`
* `pages/about.js` maps to `/about`
* `pages/account.js` maps to `/account`

Now, we have a `styles` object in this file. **Next.js** provides us with a `style` function that we can use to select style properties and apply to DOM elements as shown in the example above. **Next.js** leverages the [glamor](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor) library for the CSS-in-JS pattern. Another way of using CSS inside the JSX file with *next.js* is by importing the `css` function from `next/css` like so:

```js
import React from 'react'
import css from 'next/css'

export default () => <p className={style}>Hello World!</p>

const style = css({
  color: 'blue'
})
```

Finally, we have a `<Link>` component. We used the `Link` component that *next.js* provides. This enables client-side transitions between routes. The `Link` component grabs the post id and  links to an account route when clicked. Next, let's create the account route to be able to accept the id and render the appropriate content.

## Setting up the Account Page

Create a new file `account.js` inside the `pages` directory and add this code to it like so:

_pages/account.js_

```js

import React from 'react'
import posts from '../data/posts'
import { style } from 'next/css'
import * as  _ from 'lodash'

export default ({ url: { query: { id } } }) => {
  const item =  _.find(posts, { id: id })

  return (
    <div className={style(styles.main)}>
      <div className={style(styles.header)}>
        <h3> NEXTHRONE - THE REVELATION OF GAME OF THRONES' CHARACTERS </h3>
      </div>
      <div className={style(styles.panel)}>
        <h1 className={style(styles.heading)}>
          Character: { item.codeName }
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Real Name: { item.realName }
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Brief Description:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <span> { item.story } </span>
        </h1>
      </div>

      <div className={style(styles.singlePhoto)}>
        <img src={ item.display_src} alt={item.realName} width={500} height={500} />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}


const styles = {
  main: {
    padding: '50px'
  },

  header: {
    font: '15px Monaco',
    textAlign: 'center'
  },

  panel: {
    float: 'right',
    marginRight: '140px',
    width: '300px'
  },

  singlePhoto: {
    border: '1px solid #999',
    width: '500px',
    height: '500px',
    float: 'left'
  },

  heading: {
    font: '15px Monaco'
  }
}
```

Go ahead and install [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash). With the help of lodash, we can traverse the posts array to find the other properties of an object based on the `id` it receives from the query. This code  `export default ({ url: { query: { id } } })` grabs the value of `id` that is part of a url query. For example `https://auth0.com/learn?id=javascript` will return `javascript`. So, in our code above, it gets the `id` from the url, uses lodash to get the object properties based on the id, then assign them to the `item` variable. With that, we can now output the `realName`, `codeName`, `story` and `display_src` on the screen like we did above!

Now, when we click on a character from the index page, we should be redirected to an account page that shows the full info of the character like so:

![NexThrone-annotated](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/nexthrone-annotated.png)
_Clicking on Index Page_

![Arya Stark Account Page](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/aryastark.png)
_Arya Stark Account Page_

![Mellisandre Account Page](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/mellisandre.png)
_Mellisandre Account Page_

It's that simple. Now, we have a fully functional server-rendered universal JavaScript web application.

## Custom Config and Error Handling

![404 Error](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/404.png)
_Next.js 404 Error Page_

![500 Error](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/500.png)
_Next.js 500 Error Page_

Sometimes you might need a more advanced routing than the option that **Next.js** provides, *Next.js* still allows you to intercept the request and do whatever you want. Check [here](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/25) for comprehensive info on how to achieve that.

**Next.js** has a default component, *_error.js* that handles 404 and 500 errors on both client and server side. You can override it like so:

```js

import React from 'react'

export default class Error extends React.Component {
  static getInitialProps ({ res, xhr }) {
    const errorCode = res ? res.statusCode : xhr.status
    return { errorCode }
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <p>An error { this.props.errorCode } just occurred</p>
    )
  }
}
```

## Hosting | Deploying to Production

For Heroku lovers, there is a nice [build adapter here](https://github.com/mars/heroku-nextjs) that helps deploy your **Next.js** apps to Heroku.

The creators of **Next.js** also have a tool, [now](https://zeit.co/now) that you can deploy your app with. Check out the instructions on how to deploy [here](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#productiondeployment).

## Aside: Authenticating a Next.js App with Auth0

**Auth0** issues [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) on every login for your users. This means that you can have a solid [identity infrastructure](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), including [single sign-on](https://auth0.com/docs/sso/single-sign-on), user management, support for social identity providers (Facebook, Github, Twitter, etc.), enterprise identity providers (Active Directory, LDAP, SAML, etc.) and your own database of users with just a few lines of code.

We can easily set up authentication in our **Next.js** apps by using the [Auth0.js library](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js). If you don't already have an Auth0 account, <a href="https://auth0.com/signup" data-amp-replace="CLIENT_ID" data-amp-addparams="anonId=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name)">sign up</a> for one now. Navigate to the Auth0 [management dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/), click on `New client` by the right hand side, select Regular Web App from the dialog box and then go ahead to the `Settings` tab where the client ID and domain can be retreived.

**Note:** Make sure you set the  `Allowed Callback URLs` to `http://localhost:3000/callback` or whatever url/port you are running on. 

### Step 1

Open up `utils/AuthService.js` and modify the code to look like this below:

_utils/AuthService.js_

```js
import React from 'react'

export default class AuthService {
  constructor(clientId, domain) {
    // Configure Auth0
    this.clientId = clientId;
    this.domain = domain;

    this.auth0 = new window.auth0.WebAuth({
      domain: domain,
      clientID: clientId,
      scope: 'openid profile',
      responseType: 'token id_token',
      redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/callback'
    });

    // binds login functions to keep this context
    this.login = this.login.bind(this);
  }

  parseHash(callback) {
    this.auth0.parseHash((err, result) => {
      if(err) {
        console.log(err);
        callback(false);
        this.logout();
        return;
      }

      this.setToken(result.accessToken);
      callback(true);
    });
  }

  login() {    
    this.auth0.authorize();
  }

  loggedIn(){
    // Checks if there is a saved token and it's still valid
    return !!this.getToken();
  }

  setToken(accessToken){
    // Saves user token to localStorage
    localStorage.setItem('accessToken', accessToken);
  }

  getToken(){
    // Retrieves the user token from localStorage
    return localStorage.getItem('accessToken');
  }

  logout(){
    // Clear user token from localStorage
    localStorage.removeItem('accessToken');
  }
}
```

### Step 2

Open up `pages/index.js` and modify the code to look like so:

_pages/index.js_

```js
import React from 'react'
import posts from '../data/posts'
import settings from '../data/settings'
import { style } from 'next/css'
import Link from 'next/link'
import AuthService from '../utils/AuthService'

export default class extends React.Component {
  static getInitialProps ({ req, res}) {
    return { posts: posts }
  }

  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { loggedIn: false }
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.auth = new AuthService(settings.clientId, settings.domain);
    this.setState({ loggedIn: this.auth.loggedIn() });
    this.auth.callback = () => {
      this.setState({ loggedIn: this.auth.loggedIn() });
    };
  }

  login() {
    this.auth.login();
  }

  render() {

   const loginButton = this.state.loggedIn ? <div>HELLO</div> : <button onClick={this.login.bind(this)}>Login</button>;

    return (
      <div>
      <div className={style(styles.header)}>
        <script src="https://cdn.auth0.com/js/auth0/9.0.0/auth0.min.js"></script>
        { loginButton }
        <h3> NEXTHRONE - THE REVELATION OF GAME OF THRONES' CHARACTERS </h3>
      </div>
      <table className={style(styles.table)}>
        <thead>
          <tr>
              <th className={style(styles.th)}>Character</th>
              <th className={style(styles.th)}>Real Name</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {
              this.props.posts.map( (post, i) => (
                  <tr key={i}>

Replace client ID and Auth0 domain values in the `settings` object with the values from your [dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). We created a state called `loggedIn` and instantiated the AuthService in `componentDidMount`. Now Auth0.js is not isomorphic, so we need to load the script from the CDN to make it available in our component within the render method. Based on the state of `loggedIn`, you will have the ability to have access to the link that redirects to the account or not!

Now, run the app, the login button should appear at the top like so:

![NexThrone Index](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/nexthrone-login.png)
_NexThrone Index Non-loggedIn Status_

User clicks on the login button and the Auth0 login screen displays like so:

![NexThrone Auth0 Login Screen](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/nexthrone-auth0lock.png)
_NexThrone Auth0 Login Screen_

Once you log in successfully, you will now have access to the links like so:

![NexThrone Logged-in Status](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/nexthrone-loggedin.png)
_NexThrone Logged-in Status_

Now you are logged-in and the `access token` is present in Local Storage. You can now click on the link to have access to the account page.

### Step 3

We need to restrict access to the account page if the user is not logged-in. If the `access token` doesn't exist, then it means the user has been logged out. So open up your `pages/account.js` and modify the code like so:

_pages/account.js_

```js
import React from 'react'
import posts from '../data/posts'
import settings from '../data/settings'
import { style } from 'next/css'
import * as  _ from 'lodash'
import AuthService from '../utils/AuthService'

export default class extends React.Component {

  componentDidMount() {
    this.auth = new AuthService(settings.clientId, settings.domain);
    if (!this.auth.loggedIn()) {
      this.props.url.replaceTo('/');
    }
  }

  render () {
    const item =  _.find(posts, { id: this.props.url.query.id });

    return (
      <div className={style(styles.main)}>
        <script src="https://cdn.auth0.com/js/auth0/9.0.0/auth0.min.js"></script>
        <div className={style(styles.header)}>
          <h3> NEXTHRONE - THE REVELATION OF GAME OF THRONES' CHARACTERS </h3>
        </div>
        <div className={style(styles.panel)}>
          <h1 className={style(styles.heading)}>
            Character: { item.codeName }
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Real Name: { item.realName }
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Brief Description:
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <span> { item.story } </span>
          </h1>
        </div>

        <div className={style(styles.singlePhoto)}>
          <img src={ item.display_src} alt={item.realName} width={500} height={500} />
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
}


const styles = {
  main: {
    padding: '50px'
  },

  header: {
    font: '15px Monaco',
    textAlign: 'center'
  },

  panel: {
    float: 'right',
    marginRight: '140px',
    width: '300px'
  },

  singlePhoto: {
    border: '1px solid #999',
    width: '500px',
    height: '500px',
    float: 'left'
  },

  heading: {
    font: '15px Monaco'
  }
}
```

In the `componentDidMount`, we just simply check if the user is logged in or not. If the user is not logged in, then the user will be redirected to the index page to log in.

### Step 4

We still need to add one more special page for everything to work. Put this code in the `pages/callback.js` file:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import settings from '../data/settings'
import AuthService from '../utils/AuthService'

export default class extends React.Component {

  componentDidMount() {
    this.auth = new AuthService(settings.clientId, settings.domain);
    this.auth.parseHash(() => {
        this.props.url.replaceTo('/');
    });
  }

  render () {
    return <script src="https://cdn.auth0.com/js/auth0/9.0.0/auth0.min.js"></script>;
  }
}
```

This is a special page that processes the information returned after a login attempt. This information is passed to the `AuthService` instance so that Auth0.js can handle it. Nothing is rendered by this page.

**Note:** If you want to use Auth0 authentication to authorize _API requests_, note that you'll need to use [a different flow depending on your use case](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/which-oauth-flow-to-use). [Access tokens should be used to authorize APIs](https://auth0.com/blog/why-should-use-accesstokens-to-secure-an-api/). You can read more about [making API calls with Auth0 here](https://auth0.com/docs/apis).

The source code for the authentication part of the NexThrone app can be found on the [adding-auth branch here](https://github.com/auth0-blog/nextjs-got/tree/adding-auth)

## Conclusion

With **Next.js**, we have been able to implement a Universal JavaScript web app in a very short time without overthinking the whole process. I'm optimistic that this young framework will grow very quickly and provide lots of options and configurations that will make building Universal JavaScript apps a breeze.

Have you used **Next.js** ? What are your thoughts about it? Please let me know in the comments section!
