With the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://auth0.com/blog/get-ready-for-gdpr/) set to come into force May 25, 2018, [Jonathan Armstrong](https://twitter.com/armstrongjp), technology and compliance lawyer with [Cordery](http://www.corderycompliance.com/), hosted a webinar with Auth0 to discuss and clarify the truths behind rumors and misconceptions regarding GDPR and what it means.

## GDPR: The Fight Against Fake News

Since the announcement of GDPR, fake news has been circulating about the upcoming EU data privacy regulation. False rumors have been perpetuated in webinars or at events. Such misconceptions can cause major issues for organizations. For example, if the CFO of a financial institution is told that GDPR doesn't apply to financial services, budgets can be substantially withdrawn due to misinformation.

To read an introduction to GDPR and how it affects businesses and organizations, please check out [Get Ready for GDPR](https://auth0.com/blog/get-ready-for-gdpr/). You can also [go here to read the regulation itself](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG).

The **GDPR: The Fight Against Fake News** webinar addresses several _false_ conceptions regarding GDPR. Fake news items about GDPR include the following:

* GDPR only applies to Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
* GDPR doesn't apply to financial services or the health sector
* Organizations outside the EU don't have any liability
* GDPR looks good but won't be enforced
* GDPR won't apply because of Brexit
* and much more

All of the above are inaccurate, and Jonathan Armstrong explains why in the webinar. He also responds to several more fake news items that have been circulating since the announcement of GDPR.

With GDPR approaching enforcement on May 25, 2018, it's more important than ever to be knowledgeable about the regulation and its impact. In addition, learn how organizations can benefit from improved businesses processes in their preparation for GDPR. Don't be fooled by GDPR fake news: get informed by checking out the webinar below.
