**TL;DR:** In this series, you will learn how to create modern web applications with Python, Flask, and Angular. You will use this stack to build a SPA and a backend API to expose exams and questions so users can test their knowledge regarding different technologies. [In this GitHub repository](https://github.com/auth0-blog/python-flask-angular-3/), you can find the final code created throughout the third part of the series (this one).

So far, this series contains three parts:

1. [Part 1 includes topics like bootstrapping the Flask application, managing Entities with SQLAlchemy ORM, and bootstrapping the Angular application](https://auth0.com/blog/using-python-flask-and-angular-to-build-modern-apps-part-1/).
2. [Part 2 includes topics like securing Flask Apps, handling Angular forms, and securing Angular Apps](https://auth0.com/blog/using-python-flask-and-angular-to-build-modern-web-apps-part-2/).
3. [Part 3 (this one) includes topics like configuring Angular Material, handling Authorization, and migrating Databases with Alembic](https://auth0.com/blog/using-python-flask-and-angular-to-build-modern-web-apps-part-3/).

## What You Will Build

In this series, you will use Python, Flask, and Angular to build a web application based on a modern architecture. With Angular, you will build a SPA (Single Page App) that allows users to browse through exams and questions. These users, when authenticated, will be able to test their knowledge regarding a specific topic by choosing one of the multiple choices that a question exposes. Then, when your users submit their answers, your backend will check if they are right or wrong, record the result, and send back this result to users.

In this part of the series, you will start by installing and configuring [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io) to add a nice interface to your app with ease. Then, you will use Angular Material components like [Button](https://material.angular.io/components/button/overview), [Card](https://material.angular.io/components/card/overview), [Dialog](https://material.angular.io/components/dialog/overview), and [Toolbar](https://material.angular.io/components/tooltip/overview) to enhance the look and feel of your application.

After that, you will refactor both the frontend and the backend apps to support some more features like question management. Throughout the process, you will learn how you can take advantage of roles to limit what some type of users can do. For example, although it might be a good idea to let the community help adding new exams and questions, you will want to restrict which users can update and delete existing ones.

## Installing and Configuring Angular Material

[The official website contains some good documentation on how to install, configure, and use Angular Material on Angular applications](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started). However, for newcomers, the information might look a little scattered. So, in this article, you are going to focus on what is needed to get up and running with this UI (User Interface) component framework as fast as possible.

So, the first thing you will need to do is to install some dependencies:

```bash
# make sure you move the cursor to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# install dependencies with NPM
npm i @angular/material @angular/cdk hammerjs
```

You will need the first two libraries in the command above, `@angular/material` and `@angular/cdk`, to use Angular Material in any application. [You will also install the third library, `hammerjs`, to add gesture support to your app](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started#step-5-gesture-support).

After installing these dependencies, you will need to update the `index.html` file. The new version of this file will add two other external dependencies ([the Roboto font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) and [Material Icons](https://material.io/icons/)) and will make Angular Material default style apply to all native elements on your app:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Online Exams</title>
  <base href="/">

  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <section class="mat-typography">
    <app-root></app-root>
  </section>
</body>
</html>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Then, you will want to update the `styles.css` file to apply [an Angular Material theme (in this case Indigo Pink)](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming#using-a-pre-built-theme) and to remove the margin applied by browsers on the `body` element:

```css
@import "~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css";

body {
    margin: 0;
}
```

Also, before moving into the process of adding Angular Material components, you will need to update the `main.ts` file to apply `hammer.js`:

```typescript
import 'hammerjs';

// ... everything else ...
```

With these changes in place, you have properly installed and configured Angular Material in your application. So, it's a good time to save your work:

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "installing and configuring Angular Material"
```

### Using Angular Material Components

Now that you finished configuring Angular Material, you can move forward and make use of the first components to build an appealing UI. More precisely, you will start by using the Toolbar and Button components to add a navigation bar to the top of your application.

To use these components, you will need to add them to your `AppModule`. So, open the `app.module.ts` file and update it as follows:

```typescript
import {NoopAnimationsModule} from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';
import {MatToolbarModule, MatButtonModule} from '@angular/material';

// ... other imports ...

// ... const appRoutes

@NgModule({
  // ... declarations ...
  imports: [
    // ... other imports ...
    NoopAnimationsModule,
    MatToolbarModule,
    MatButtonModule,
  ],
  // ... providers and boostrap ...
})
// ... export class AppModule ...
```

> **Note:** In the code snippet above, you are using `NoopAnimationsModule` to avoid adding another dependency to your project. [If you are interested in using animations, check this URL](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started#step-2-animations).

Then, you can refactor the `AppComponent` class to use these components. So, open the `app.component.ts` file and replace its code with the following one:

```typescript
import {Component, OnInit} from '@angular/core';
import * as Auth0 from 'auth0-web';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <mat-toolbar color="primary" class="mat-elevation-z10">
      <button mat-button>Online Exams</button>
      <button mat-button>About</button>

      <!-- This fills the remaining space of the current row -->
      <span class="fill-remaining-space"></span>

      <button mat-button (click)="signIn()" *ngIf="!authenticated">Sign In</button>
      <button mat-button (click)="signOut()" *ngIf="authenticated">Sign Out</button>
    </mat-toolbar>

    <router-outlet></router-outlet>
  `,
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  authenticated = false;

  signIn = Auth0.signIn;
  signOut = Auth0.signOut;

  ngOnInit() {
    const self = this;
    Auth0.subscribe((authenticated) => (self.authenticated = authenticated));
  }
}
```

The new version of this file adds the `mat-toolbar` element to the top of the page with four buttons:

1. _Online Exams_: You will make this button redirect users to the home page.
2. _About_: You will create a view called _About_ and make this button redirect users there.
3. _Sign In_: You added this button to allow visitors to sign in to your application.
4. _Sign Out_: You added this button to allow users to close their current session.

What is interesting about these changes is that, since the `AppComponent` also defines where other views will appear (through the `router-outlet` element), the `mat-toolbar` element will be visible to all your views.

Note that you also made use of the Button component provided by the Angular Material framework by adding the `mat-button` directive to `button` elements. Besides that, you have added a `span` element to your toolbar that uses a class called `fill-remaining-space`. The goal of this class is to make this element fill all the unused space in the navbar. As you haven't defined the rules of this class yet, open the `app.component.css` file and add the following code to it:

```css
.fill-remaining-space {
  /* This fills the remaining space, by using flexbox.
     Every toolbar row uses a flexbox row layout. */
  flex: 1 1 auto;
}
```

Now, as you have moved the _Sign In_ and _Sign Out_ buttons to the `AppComponent`, you can remove them and the related code from the `ExamsComponent`. So, open the `exams.component.ts` file and replace its code with this:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
import * as Auth0 from 'auth0-web';
import {Component, OnDestroy, OnInit} from '@angular/core';
import {Subscription} from 'rxjs/Subscription';
import {Exam} from './exam.model';
import {ExamsApiService} from './exams-api.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'exams',
  template: `
    <div>
      <button routerLink="/new-exam">New Exam</button>
      <ul>
        <li *ngFor="let exam of examsList">
          {{exam.title}}
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  `
})
export class ExamsComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  examsListSubs: Subscription;
  examsList: Exam[];
  authenticated = false;

  constructor(private examsApi: ExamsApiService) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.examsListSubs = this.examsApi
      .getExams()
      .subscribe(res => {
          this.examsList = res;
        },
        console.error
      );
    const self = this;
    Auth0.subscribe((authenticated) => (self.authenticated = authenticated));
  }

  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.examsListSubs.unsubscribe();
  }
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

That's it! If you run your application now, you will see a nice _blueish_ navigation bar.

```bash
# not really needed, but if you want to see exams run the Flask app
cd ../backend
./bootstrap.sh &
cd ../frontend

# start the local development server
npm start
```

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "adding navbar to the Angular app"
```

{% include tweet_quote.html quote_text="Using Angular Material is easy and straightforward." %}

### Using Angular Material Cards

After adding a nice navigation bar to your Angular application, you can enhance the look and feel of the view that shows existing exams. In this view, you can use [the Card component](https://material.angular.io/components/card/overview) to show each exam in separately and some nice action buttons to enable users to add new exams and to start practicing their knowledge.

To make these changes in your app, you will need to update the `app.module.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import {
  MatToolbarModule, MatButtonModule, MatCardModule
} from '@angular/material';

// ... other imports and appRoutes definition ...

@NgModule({
  // ... declarations ...
  imports: [
    // ... other imports ...
    MatCardModule,
  ],
  // ... providers and bootstrap ...
})
// ... export class AppModule ...
```

After that, you will have to change the `template` property of the `ExamsComponent` and add a style sheet (`styleUrls`) to it. So, open the `exams.component.ts` file and update it as follows:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
// ... import statements ...

@Component({
  selector: 'exams',
  template: `
    <h2>Exams</h2>
    <p>Choose an exam and start studying.</p>
    <div class="exams">
      <mat-card class="example-card" *ngFor="let exam of examsList" class="mat-elevation-z5">
        <mat-card-content>
          <mat-card-title>{{exam.title}}</mat-card-title>
          <mat-card-subtitle>{{exam.description}}</mat-card-subtitle>
          <p>
            Etiam enim purus, vehicula nec dapibus quis, egestas eu quam.
            Nullam eleifend auctor leo, vitae rhoncus mi sodales vel.
            Aenean fermentum laoreet volutpat. Integer quam orci,
            molestie non nibh suscipit, faucibus euismod sapien.
          </p>
          <button mat-raised-button color="accent">Start Exam</button>
        </mat-card-content>
      </mat-card>
    </div>
    <button mat-fab color="primary" *ngIf="authenticated"
            class="new-exam" routerLink="/new-exam">
      <i class="material-icons">note_add</i>
    </button>
  `,
  styleUrls: ['exams.component.css'],
})
// ... export class ExamsComponent ...
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In this version of the `ExamsComponent`, you are iterating over the `examsList`retrieved from the Flask application to create `mat-card` elements. Each of these elements is composed of a `mat-card-title` to show the exams titles and a `mat-card-subtitle` to show its descriptions. Also, you added a `p` element with some placeholder text to simulate the long description property of the exams. Soon, you will replace this placeholder with real data retrieved from the backend. Still on the `mat-card` elements, you are adding a pink action button (`<button mat-raised-button color="accent"`) that will enable users to start taking the exam in question.

Lastly, you are adding another action button, this time blue (`<button mat-fab color="primary" ...`), to enable authenticated users (`*ngIf="authenticated"`) to access the form where users can add new exams.

Now, to make your UI more appealing, you will need to create the `exams.component.css` file in the same directory of `exams.component.ts` and add the following code to it:

```css
div.exams {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-gap: 15px;
}

button.new-exam {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 15px;
  right: 15px;
}

@media (max-width: 720px) {
  div.exams {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
```

These CSS rules take advantage of [the Grid layout system](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) to show two columns of exams on large devices and a single column on smaller ones (`max-width: 720px`). It also defines that the button to add new exams will stay fixed on the screen on the bottom right corner.

After refactoring the `ExamsComponent`, you will need to make a small change to the `AppComponent` to set a maximum width to your views and to make them appear in the middle of the screen on large devices. So, open the `app.component.ts` file and encapsulate the `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` element inside a new `div`:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<div class="view-container">
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Then, in the `app.component.css` file, add the following rule:

```css
/* ... other rules ... */

div.view-container {
  padding: 15px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 940px;
}
```

Now, if you check your Angular application again (remember, you can always start it by simply issuing `npm start` in the `frontend` directory), you will see a screen similar to the following one:

![Using Angular Material Cards and CSS Grid layout to make beautiful and modern applications.](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/flask-angular/exams-list.png)

In the screen, the user is signed in (hence, the _Sign Out_ button and the action button to add new exams) and there are three exams persisted on the backend.

Not bad, huh? Time to save your work:

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "using Angular Material Cards and CSS Grid layout to show exams"
```

## Handling Authorization Through Roles

Now that you enhanced the UI of your application, it's time to enable users to remove existing exams. To do that, you will categorize your users into two groups: `admin` and `user`. To make things easier, you will just define that your own user (i.e. the one that contains your email address) will be the `admin` and everyone else will be set as a normal `user`. You will handle this logic through [Auth0 Rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current).

> ["Rules are functions written in JavaScript that are executed when a user authenticates to your application. They run once the authentication process is complete and you can use them to customize and extend Auth0's capabilities. They can be chained together for modular coding and can be turned on and off individually." - Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current)

So, open [the _Rules_ section on your Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/rules) and hit the _Create Rule_ button. Then, in the _Pick a rule template_ page, click on the _empty rule_ option. After that, Auth0 will redirect you to a form with two fields, one to input the _name_ of the rule (you can call it _Online Exams Roles_) and one to input its source code.

After defining a name for your new rule, paste the following code into it:

```javascript
// Set 'admin' role for bruno.krebs@auth0.com and 'user' for everyone else
// Save app_metadata to ID and access tokens
function (user, context, callback) {
  user.app_metadata = user.app_metadata || {};
  var addRolesToUser = (user, cb) => {
    if (user.email && user.email === 'bruno.krebs@auth0.com') {
      cb(null, ['admin']);
    } else {
      cb(null, ['user']);
    }
  };

  addRolesToUser(user, (err, roles) => {
    if (err) return callback(err);

    user.app_metadata.roles = roles;
    auth0.users.updateAppMetadata(user.user_id, user.app_metadata).then(() => {
      const namespace = 'https://online-exams.com/roles';
      const userRoles = user.app_metadata.roles;
      context.idToken[namespace] = userRoles;
      context.accessToken[namespace] = userRoles;
      callback(null, user, context);
    }).catch(callback);
  });
}
```

This rule is quite simple. It just checks the `email` address of the user that is authenticating and, if it is `bruno.krebs@auth0.com`, it sets the `admin` role to them. If it is not this email address, it sets `user` as the user's role. You will want to replace the email address used in the code snippet above with your own one.

> **Note:** The namespace identifier used above can be any non-Auth0 HTTP or HTTPS URL and does not have to point to an actual resource. Auth0 enforces this recommendation from OIDC regarding additional claims and will _silently exclude_ any claims that do not have a namespace. You can read more about [implementing custom claims with Auth0 here](https://auth0.com/docs/scopes/current#custom-claims).

With this rule in place, you can focus on your source code again. In your backend, the first thing you will do is to create a decorator to facilitate defining which endpoints need which roles. So, open the `auth.py` file (it in the `./backend/src/` directory) and add the following code to it:

```python

def requires_role(required_role):
    def decorator(f):
        def wrapper(**args):
            token = get_token_auth_header()
            unverified_claims = jwt.get_unverified_claims(token)

            # search current token for the expected role
            if unverified_claims.get('https://online-exams.com/roles'):
                roles = unverified_claims['https://online-exams.com/roles']
                for role in roles:
                    if role == required_role:
                        return f(**args)

            raise AuthError({
                'code': 'insuficient_roles',
                'description': 'You do not have the roles needed to perform this operation.'
            }, 401)

        return wrapper

    return decorator
```

What this code does is to define a decorator called `requires_role` role that takes one argument: `required_role`. Then, with this argument, it creates a wrapper around the annotated function that checks if any request reaching it contains a valid token with the `required_role`.

> **Note:** It is important that you use the same namespace (e.g. `https://online-exams.com/roles`) used while creating your Auth0 rule.

If the token in question contains the expected role, the wrapper calls the original function (the endpoint). Otherwise, it raises an `AuthError` stating that the user lacks privilege.

To use this decorator, you will create a new endpoint that allows administrators (i.e. users with the `admin` role) to delete existing exams. So, open the file that contains your endpoint definitions (`./backend/src/main.py`) and adds the following code to it:

```python
# coding=utf-8

# ... import statements, app definition, and other endpoints ...

@app.route('/exams/<examId>', methods=['DELETE'])
@requires_role('admin')
def delete_exam(examId):
    session = Session()
    exam = session.query(Exam).filter_by(id=examId).first()
    session.delete(exam)
    session.commit()
    session.close()
    return '', 201

# ... error handler ...
```

Here, you are simply defining a new endpoint that accepts `DELETE` requests to remove exams. These requests must contain the exam id (`<examId>`) and must be issued by a user with the `admin` role (`@requires_role('admin')`). If these premises are fulfilled, the endpoint fetches an instance from the database and use it on the `session.delete` call.

From the backend perspective, that's it. Now, you can refactor your frontend code to support the new feature. To do this, you can start by opening the `exams-api.service.ts` file (it resides in the `./frontend/src/app/exams/` directory) and add the following method to the service:

```typescript
// ... import statements ...

@Injectable()
export class ExamsApiService {
  // ... constructor and other methods ...

  deleteExam(examId: number) {
    const httpOptions = {
      headers: new HttpHeaders({
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${Auth0.getAccessToken()}`
      })
    };
    return this.http
      .delete(`${API_URL}/exams/${examId}`, httpOptions);
  }
}
```

The code in this new method is trivial, right? It just calls the `delete` method, on the `HttpClient` instance, pointing to the endpoint that you created in your backend. As you were probably expecting, you need to add the `access_token` to this call so your backend can validate it and its roles.

Now, to use this new method, open the `exams.component.ts` file and update it as follows:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
// ... import statements

@Component({
  selector: 'exams',
  template: `
    <h2>Exams</h2>
    <p>Choose an exam and start studying.</p>
    <div class="exams">
      <mat-card class="example-card" *ngFor="let exam of examsList" class="mat-elevation-z5">
        <mat-card-content>
          <mat-card-title>{{exam.title}}</mat-card-title>
          <mat-card-subtitle>{{exam.description}}</mat-card-subtitle>
          <p>
            Etiam enim purus, vehicula nec dapibus quis, egestas eu quam.
            Nullam eleifend auctor leo, vitae rhoncus mi sodales vel.
            Aenean fermentum laoreet volutpat. Integer quam orci,
            molestie non nibh suscipit, faucibus euismod sapien.
          </p>
          <button mat-raised-button color="accent">Start Exam</button>
          <button mat-button color="warn" *ngIf="isAdmin()"
                  (click)="delete(exam.id)">
            Delete
          </button>
        </mat-card-content>
      </mat-card>
    </div>
    <button mat-fab color="primary" *ngIf="authenticated"
            class="new-exam" routerLink="/new-exam">
      <i class="material-icons">note_add</i>
    </button>
  `,
  styleUrls: ['exams.component.css'],
})
export class ExamsComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  // ... class properties, constructor, and other methods ...

  delete(examId: number) {
    this.examsApi
      .deleteExam(examId)
      .subscribe(() => {
        this.examsListSubs = this.examsApi
          .getExams()
          .subscribe(res => {
              this.examsList = res;
            },
            console.error
          )
      }, console.error);
  }

  isAdmin() {
    if (!Auth0.isAuthenticated()) return false;

    const roles = Auth0.getProfile()['https://online-exams.com/roles'];
    return roles.includes('admin');
  }
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The only difference on the `template` of this component is that, now, it includes a _Delete_ button that is showed to admins only (`*ngIf="isAdmin()"`). When clicked, this button calls the `delete` method to issue the `DELETE` request to the backend. Then, when the request finishes, this method calls the `getExams` method on `examsApi` to update the list of exams.

That's it! It was easy to use roles to control who can delete exams and who cannot, right?

Hey! Don't forget to save your progress:

```bash

## Migrating Databases with Alembic

After dealing with authorization and roles, you will want to improve your application adding new features. As adding new features usually means making changes to your database (so it can support these new features), you will need a database migration tool to upgrade the database schema. Why? Mainly because you don't want to lose your data when upgrading and because you want to keep track of the changes in the long run.

So, in this section, you are going to learn about [Alembic, a migration tool developed by the author of SQLAlchemy](http://alembic.zzzcomputing.com/en/latest/). As you will see, its usage is quite simple. First, you will need to install the `alembic` package in your Python application:

```bash
# move to the backend directory
cd ./backend

# make sure pipenv is activated
pipenv shell

# install alembic
pipenv install alembic
```

After installing `alembic`, you can use issue the following command to make it auto-configure itself:

```bash
# run it in the backend directory
alembic init migrations
```

This command will create most of the files in the `migrations` directory. You won't need to touch the files in this directory now. Actually, the one file you will need to change is the `alembic.ini` file that resides outside it (you will find it in the `backend` directory itself).

Opening this file, you will see a property called `sqlalchemy.url`. Replace the value of this property so Alembic can connect to your database. If you followed the instructions to the letter, you can replace it as follows:

```bash
sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://postgres:0NLIN3-ex4m@localhost:5432/online-exam
```

Now, Alembic is able to connect itself to your database, so it's time to create your first migration. To illustrate the process, you will create a simple migration to add the `long_description` column to the `exams` table. So, in your terminal, issue the following code:

```bash
alembic revision -m "add long_description to exams"
```

This will make Alembic create a new file (under `./backend/migrations/versions`) called something similar to `28bab18a07f0_add_long_description_to_exams.py`. Opening this file you will see that it contains an `import` section, some variable, and two functions: `upgrade` and `downgrade`. For now, you are just interested in the first function, `upgrade`. In this function, you will write a one-liner code to make Alembic and SQLAlchemy add the `long_description` column to the `exams` table:

```python
# ... imports and other variables ...

def upgrade():
    op.add_column('exams', sa.Column(
        'long_description',
        sa.Text,
        nullable=False,
        server_default='Default exam description'))

# ... downgrade ...
```

> **Note:** This migration defines that the `long_description` column does not accept null values and that its default value is "Default exam description". So, any exam previously persisted in your database will have this value in the `long_description` column.

Now, to run this migration, issue the following command in your terminal:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

After running it, you will need to update the `Exam` entity in your Python application. So, open the `exam.py` file and update it as follows:

```python
# ... import statements ...

class Exam(Entity, Base):
    # ... __tablename__ and other properties ...

    def __init__(self, title, description, long_description, created_by):
        # ... __init__ and other properties ...
        self.long_description = long_description

class ExamSchema(Schema):
    # ... other fields ...
    long_description = fields.Str()
```

Lastly, you will need to make a small change to the `main.py` file to make your endpoint aware of the new property:

```python
# ... imports, definitions, and other endpoints ...

@app.route('/exams', methods=['POST'])
@requires_auth
def add_exam():
    # mount exam object
    posted_exam = ExamSchema(only=('title', 'description', 'long_description')) \
        .load(request.get_json())

    # ... the rest of the function ...

# ... imports, definitions, and other endpoints ...
```

With these changes in place, your Python backend application is now ready to persist long descriptions of exams. So, in the next section, you will refactor the frontend app to support it as well.

> **Note:** Here, you learned just the basics about Alembic. For a much more complete explanation of how it works and what you can do with this tool, check [the official Alembic documentation](http://alembic.zzzcomputing.com/en/latest/tutorial.html).

Time to save your progress!

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "configuring alembic and adding the long_description column"
```

## Refactoring the Exam's Form

In this section, you will make your frontend application support the `long_description` property. Also, you will Angular Material components to make the exam's form look better. So, for starters, you will need to import the `MatInputModule` into your `AppModule`. To do this, open the `app.module.ts` file and update it as follows:

```typescript
import {
  MatToolbarModule, MatButtonModule, MatCardModule, MatInputModule
} from '@angular/material';
// ... other imports ...

@NgModule({
  // ... declarations ...
  imports: [
    // ... other imports ...
    MatInputModule,
  ],
  // ... providers and bootstrap ...
})
// ... export class AppModule ...
```

After that, you will refactor the `ExamFormComponent`. So, open the `exam-form.component.ts` file and replace its content with this:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
import {Component} from '@angular/core';
import {ExamsApiService} from "./exams-api.service";
import {Router} from "@angular/router";

@Component({
  selector: 'exam-form',
  template: `
    <mat-card>
      <h2>New Exam</h2>
        <mat-form-field class="full-width">
          <input matInput
                 placeholder="Title"
                 (keyup)="updateTitle($event)">
        </mat-form-field>

        <mat-form-field class="full-width">
          <input matInput
                 placeholder="Description"
                 (keyup)="updateDescription($event)">
        </mat-form-field>

        <mat-form-field class="full-width">
          <textarea rows="5"
                    matInput
                    placeholder="Long Description"
                    (keyup)="updateLongDescription($event)"></textarea>
        </mat-form-field>

        <button mat-raised-button
                color="primary"
                (click)="saveExam()">
          Save Exam
        </button>
    </mat-card>
  `,
  styles: [`
    .exams-form {
      min-width: 150px;
      max-width: 500px;
      width: 100%;
    }

    .full-width {
      width: 100%;
    }
  `]
})
export class ExamFormComponent {
  exam = {
    title: '',
    description: '',
    long_description: '',
  };

  constructor(private examsApi: ExamsApiService, private router: Router) { }

  updateTitle(event: any) {
    this.exam.title = event.target.value;
  }

  updateDescription(event: any) {
    this.exam.description = event.target.value;
  }

  updateLongDescription(event: any) {
    this.exam.long_description = event.target.value;
  }

  saveExam() {
    this.examsApi
      .saveExam(this.exam)
      .subscribe(
        () => this.router.navigate(['/']),
        error => alert(error.message)
      );
  }
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The new version of this component includes a whole new `template` where you are using three Angular Material components: Card (`mat-card`), Button (`mat-raised-button`), and Form Field (`mat-form-field`). It also includes a CSS rule to make form fields (`mat-form-field`) fill all the horizontal space (`width: 100%;`). Lastly, it includes the `long_description` field in the `exam` variable and a method called `updateLongDescription` to update this field.

If you run your application now and head to this form, you will see a screen like the following:

![Angular form with Angular Material components.](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/flask-angular/new-exams-form.png)

So, to wrap up this new property, open the `exams.component.ts` file and replace the long description placeholder (the "Etiam enim purus, vehicula ..." text inside `<p></p>`) with this:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
{{exam.long_description}}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

![Show exams' long description in your Angular app](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/flask-angular/exams-with-description.png)

Done! Now, both your backend and your frontend support the long description property of exams. So it's time to save your progress:

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "supporting long_description on the frontend"
```

## Conclusion and Next Steps

In the third part of this series, you learned how to install and configure Angular Material components. Then, you used these components to add a nice interface to your Angular application. After that, you learned how to use Auth0 rules to add roles to your users and made both your backend and frontend projects aware of these roles. In the end, you learned about Alembic, a database migration tool, and used it to add a new property to exams: their long description.

In the upcoming articles, you are going to enable users to add questions to your exams and you will also let them start taking these exams. Also, you will start preparing your code for CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) tools. These tools will help you automate the development and release pipeline.

Stay tuned!
