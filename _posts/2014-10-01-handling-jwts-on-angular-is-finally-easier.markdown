  <strong>The angular-jwt library has been deprecated.</strong> The angular-jwt library is no longer maintained. Decoding JWTs on the front end is not recommended, and all other features of the library are easily implemented in AngularJS without the use of an additional library.
</div>

Following our blog post about [how to use JWTs on AngularJS](https://auth0.com/blog/2014/01/07/angularjs-authentication-with-cookies-vs-token/#comment-1506375766), we've decided to go one step further to make this simpler.

**We've created a library called [angular-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/angular-jwt)** to handle some of the common problems that arise when dealing with JWTs. We'll soon be using this library in our own [Angular SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular) to handle JWTs as well.

Throughout this article we'll go over some of the common questions asked by our customers that we aim to solve with [angular-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/angular-jwt).

### How do you get the information (claims) from a [JWT](http://jwt.io/)?

As you know, a [JWT](http://jwt.io/) is a token that's not opaque, thus it has information. To get that information, you can use the following code:

````js
angular.module('app', ['angular-jwt'])
.controller('Controller', function Controller(jwtHelper) {
  var aToken = 'eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiQXV0aDAiLCJleHAiOjE0MTIyMzQ3MzB9.ZJzxkw4DNohrdk209erOGyVhfZiAQTRLHMR0BuNUuBA';

  var tokenPayload = jwtHelper.decodeToken(aToken);
})
````


> **Note**: You can try this out online in this [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/mgonto/s4tkms31/)

### How can I check if a JWT has expired?

Most JWTs will eventually [expire](http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html#expDef). In order to know when and if a token is expired you can use the following code:

````js
angular.module('app', ['angular-jwt'])
.controller('Controller', function Controller(jwtHelper) {
  var aToken = 'eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiQXV0aDAiLCJleHAiOjE0MTIyMzQ3MzB9.ZJzxkw4DNohrdk209erOGyVhfZiAQTRLHMR0BuNUuBA';

  var expireDate = jwtHelper.getTokenExpirationDate(aToken);
  var isExpired = jwtHelper.isTokenExpired(aToken);
});
````


> **Note**: You can try this out online in this [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/mgonto/w588gy87/)

### How can I send the JWT on every request to the server?

Once you have the JWT, you want to send it to the server on every request in the `Authorization` header. For that, you can use the following code:

````js
angular.module('app', ['angular-jwt'])
.config(function Config($httpProvider, jwtInterceptorProvider) {
  jwtInterceptorProvider.tokenGetter = function() {
    return localStorage.getItem('JWT');
  }
  $httpProvider.interceptors.push('jwtInterceptor');
})
.controller('Controller', function Controller($http) {
  // If localStorage contains the id_token it will be sent in the request
  // Authorization: Bearer [yourToken] will be sent
  $http({
    url: '/hi',
    method: 'GET'
  });
}
````

> **Note**: You can try this out online in this [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/mgonto/dqo5q2xn/)

### How do I refresh a token that expired?

As we've covered in the previous question, JWTs expire. Once a JWT expire, if you send it to the server, you'll get a 401 Status Code.

However, you can use [refresh tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/refresh-token) to get a new (not expired) JWT from your server. For that, you can use a [delegation endpoint](https://docs.auth0.com/auth-api#post--delegation).

This is how you'd accomplish that with `angular-jwt`:


````js
angular.module('app', ['angular-jwt'])
.config(function Config($httpProvider, jwtInterceptorProvider) {
  jwtInterceptorProvider.tokenGetter = function(jwtHelper, $http) {
    var jwt = localStorage.getItem('JWT');
    var refreshToken = localStorage.getItem('refresh_token');
    if (jwtHelper.isTokenExpired(jwt)) {
      // This is a promise of a JWT id_token
      return $http({
        url: '/delegation',
        // This will not send the JWT for this call
        skipAuthorization: true,
        method: 'POST',
        refresh_token : refreshToken
      }).then(function(response) {
        localStorage.setItem('JWT', response.data.jwt);
        return jwt;
      });
    } else {
      return jwt;
    }
  }
  $httpProvider.interceptors.push('jwtInterceptor');
})
.controller('Controller', function Controller($http) {
  // Authorization: Bearer [yourToken] will be sent.
  // That token might be a new one which was got from the refresh token
  $http({
    url: '/hi',
    method: 'GET'
  });
})
````

These are only some of the things that you can do with [angular-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/angular-jwt).

Now, add angular-jwt to your `bower.json` or `package.json` and start hacking!
