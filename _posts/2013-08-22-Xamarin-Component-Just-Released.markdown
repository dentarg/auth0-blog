We are very excited to announce the release of the [Auth0 Component](http://components.xamarin.com/view/Auth0Client/) for Xamarin. As with the other SDKs we released (and [available on Github](http://github.com/auth0)), its goal is to streamline authentication with any of our [supported identity providers](http://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders). Consumer or Enterprise.

The API is straight forward and very easy to use. It works with iOS and Android:

<code>
    var auth0 = new Auth0Client(
        "{subDomain}",
        "{clientID}",
        "{clientSecret}");

     auth0.LoginAsync (this)
           .ContinueWith(t => {
              var facebook_token = t.Result.Profile["identities"][0]["access_token"];
              var email = t.Result.Profile["email"].ToString();
 	          });
</code>

The code above will display the [Auth0 login widget](https://docs.auth0.com/login-widget) as seen in the picture above.

It is delivered as a [component](http://components.xamarin.com/), so you can get it straight into Xamarin Studio.

What you get back after login is the [normalized user profile](https://docs.auth0.com/user-profile) and [Json Web Token](https://auth0.com/learn/json-web-tokens/) you can use to authenticate calls with your API.

Here's a quick end to end demo (use full screen):

Last but not least, if you have **Windows Azure Mobile Services** enabled in Auth0, then you can use the token to call WAMS endpoints with no changes or additional code. Auth0 will generate [the right JWT](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt#5) for you.

We want to thank the folks at Xamarin for their support and great experience!
