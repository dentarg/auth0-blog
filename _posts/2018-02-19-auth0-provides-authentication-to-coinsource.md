**BELLEVUE, Wash. -- February 19, 2018** – [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), a global leader in Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS), today announced that it has been selected by [Coinsource](http://www.coinsource.net/), the world’s largest Bitcoin ATM operator and network, to provide authentication to its expanding customer base. Auth0 will enable secure log-in, account set-up and access for customers at any of the 250+ Coinsource ATM machines across the country. 

Coinsource has leveraged the tremendous growth of Bitcoin to provide an easy and secure way for people to convert Bitcoin to cash, and vice versa, based on their everyday transaction needs. With customers and ATMs continually being added to the Coinsource network, they were in need of a scalable identity platform that could support this expansion as Bitcoin becomes more mainstream. 

_“Auth0 is an easy-to-use platform that Coinsource utilizes to streamline our customers’ experience,”_ said CEO of Coinsource, Sheffield Clark. _“We’re excited to be providing this extra level of security exclusively for our customers.”_

_”Bitcoin’s growth over the past couple years is impressive,”_ said Eugenio Pace, CEO and co-founder of Auth0. _“We are always excited to work with companies that are on the cutting-edge of their respective industries, and Coinsource is an excellent representation of that.”_ 

Coinsource represents Auth0’s foray into Bitcoin, adding to the diverse and broad list of financial institutions the company currently works with. Authentication, Enterprise Federation, API security, and Multifactor Authentication, along with Auth0’s compliance with strict banking regulations, makes Auth0 a compelling choice for any company in the financial services sector.
