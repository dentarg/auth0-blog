**TL;DR:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It has gained massive adoption by developers and organizations around the world because of it's efficient, event-driven and non-blocking I/O model. Node.js makes it possible for developers to code the most popular language (JavaScript) in the world on the backend. Furthermore, Node.js's package manager,`npm`, houses the largest distribution of open source libraries in the world. Node.js and npm just had new major releases. In this article, we'll highlight 7 notable additions to Node.js and dabble into the new monster, **npm@5**.

---

Node.js 8.0.0 was announced to the world on May 31, 2017. The previous Node.js version was v7.10.0. The *v* was dropped in order to avoid confusion with the V8 JavaScript engine. This major release brings a lot of new features, deprecations and changes. By October, 2017, Node.js 8 will become a Long Term Support (LTS) release. Next, notable additions!

## 1. Node.js API (N-API)

Currently, this is an experimental feature behind a flag. 30 percent of JavaScript modules rely indirectly on native modules.

Existing native modules are written in C/C++ and directly depend on V8 or [Native Abstractions for Node.js (NAN)](https://github.com/nodejs/nan) APIs. This dependency requires native modules to be recompiled and updated for every major Node.js release. This is a burden for native modules maintainers. Furthermore, companies and products depending on these modules find it difficult to upgrade their Node.js versions in production because of potential massive code breakage.

Now, the **N-API** is here to eliminate breakage of dependencies that happens between release lines with native modules. The full N-API functions can be found in the [documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html).

{% include tweet_quote.html quote_text="N-API is here to eliminate breakage of dependencies that happens between release lines with native modules." %}

**Note:** These 5 modules, [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass), [canvas](https://github.com/jasongin/node-canvas) , [leveldown](https://github.com/boingoing/leveldown/) , [nanomsg](https://github.com/sampsongao/node-nanomsg), and [iotivity](https://github.com/gabrielschulhof/iotivity-node/tree/abi-stable) have successfully been ported to use N-API.

Native modules builders and users can start experimenting with this feature. More details can be found [here](https://medium.com/@nodejs/n-api-next-generation-node-js-apis-for-native-modules-169af5235b06).

## 2. Better Support for Promises

This release includes a new `util.promisify()` [API](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_promisify_original) that allows developers to wrap standard callback-style APIs in a function that returns a Promise. Check out this sample code:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const util = require('util');

const readfile = util.promisify(fs.readFile);

readfile('/some/file')
  .then((data) => { /** ... **/ })
  .catch((err) => { /** ... **/ });
```

## 3. Buffer Improvements

The Node.js Buffer API witnessed a lot of changes. Most notable amongst these changes is:

* Zero-filling new instances of Buffer(num) by default will have a negative significant impact on performance. The positive side of zero-filling Buffer is that it helps to prevent information leaks.

You want Buffer instances with uninitialized memory? No problem! Use the `Buffer.allocUnsafe(num)` API.

```js
// Zero-filled Buffers
const safeBuffer1 = Buffer.alloc(20);
const safeBuffer2 = new Buffer(20);

// Uninitialized Buffer
const unsafeBuffer = Buffer.allocUnsafe(20);
```

> **Note:** Developers should be very careful when using the `Buffer.allocUnsafe`. Only use it when you are aware of the risks and how to avoid it.

## 4. Stable WHATWG URL Parser

This release makes the **WHATWG URL** parser fully supported. No more hiding behind the experimental flag. It's a URL API implementation that matches the `URL` implementation in modern web browsers like Firefox, Edge, Chrome, and Safari allowing code using URLs to be shared across environments. The URL implementation will be handled equally on these modern browsers.

```js
const myURL = new URL('/foo', 'https://example.org/');

// result
https://example.org/foo

const myURL = new URL('https://example.org/foo#bar');
console.log(myURL.hash);
// returns #bar

console.log(myURL.href);
// returns https://example.org/foo#baz
```

## 5. async_hooks

The experimental `async_hooks` module otherwise known as `async_wrap` has received a major bump in Node.js 8.

This API gives developers the ability to register callbacks tracking the lifetime of asynchronous resources created inside a Node.js application. An asynchronous resource represents an object with an associated callback. Some of the API methods can be found below:

```js
const async_hooks = require('async_hooks');

const cid = async_hooks.currentId();
// returns the ID of the current execution context.

const tid = async_hooks.triggerId();
// returns the ID of the handle responsible for triggering the callback of the current execution scope to call.

// Create a new AsyncHook instance. All of these callbacks are optional.
const asyncHook = async_hooks.createHook({ init, before, after, destroy });
```

Look at this example below:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const async_hooks = require('async_hooks');

async_hooks.createHook({
  init(asyncId, type, triggerId) {
    const cId = async_hooks.currentId();
    fs.writeSync(1, `${type}(${asyncId}): trigger: ${triggerId} scope: ${cId}\n`);
    }
  }).enable();

require('net').createServer((conn) => {}).listen(8080);
```

Output when hitting the server with `nc localhost 8080`:

```
TCPWRAP(2): trigger: 1 scope: 1
TCPWRAP(4): trigger: 2 scope: 0
```

The first `TCPWRAP` is the server which receives the connections. The second `TCPWRAP` is the new connection from the client. When a new connection is made the `TCPWrap` instance is immediately constructed. This happens outside of any JavaScript stack (side note: a `currentId()` of `0`
means it's being executed from C++, with no JavaScript stack above it). With only that information it would be impossible to link resources together in terms of what caused them to be created, so `triggerId` is given the task of propagating what resource is responsible for the new resource's existence.

The full documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/13287).

## 6. Stream API Improvements

This release adds new ways for destroying and finalizing Stream instances. Every Stream instance will now inherit a `destroy()` method, the implementation of which can be customized and extended by providing a custom implementation of the `_destroy()` method.

```js
myStream._destroy = function (cb) {
  closeResources(function (err) {
    cb(err)
  })
}

myStream.destroy();
```

The [_destroy()](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_writable_destroy_err_callback) method can take in two arguments, the `err` and `callback` function. The callback function takes an optional error argument which is invoked when the stream is destroyed.

From the code above, there is a custom implementation of the `_destroy()` method. So calling the `destroy()` method destroys the stream, and emits the passed error.

## 7. Inspector JavaScript API

Developers have a new way of debugging their Node.js applications via the experimental inspector JavaScript API. This API leverages the debug protocol to inspect various Node.js processes.

The `inspector` module provides an API for interacting with the V8 inspector.

```js
const inspector = require('inspector');

const session = new inspector.Session();
session.connect();

// Listen for inspector events
session.on('inspectorNotification', (message) => {
  // Do whatever
});

// Send messages to the inspector
session.post(message);

session.disconnect();
```

There are other events such as the `Debugger.paused` and `Debugger.resumed` events that you can listen to with this module.

> Note: Node.js 8.0.0 ships with **npm 5**.

Let's highlight major changes in *npm 5*.

## npm@5

**npm's** latest version is `npm@5`. What's new in **npm@5**?

### 1. Wicked Fast Install

I bumped my npm version to npm 5 using `npm install npm@latest -g` and the first thing I discovered was that my module installs were insanely fast!

![Speed improvements](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*K1Wb1ERhtAHLRG0m.)
_Installing react-native_

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">With <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/npm5?src=hash">#npm5</a> about to come out, I thought I&#39;d update those benchmarks.<br><br>Here&#39;s the npm5 code I&#39;m working on, vs npm@4.6.1 on a popular repo <a href="https://t.co/KWPfbpE46p">pic.twitter.com/KWPfbpE46p</a></p>&mdash; âœ¨11x gayer Katâœ¨ (@maybekatz) <a href="https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/865393382260056064">May 19, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

One of the benefits of Yarn over npm was faster package install, but with `npm@5`, you don't need to brew coffee anymore during waiting time! Your modules install before you say Jack! Well, literally not at that speed, but it takes lesser time to install node modules. Significant performance improvements of 20 to 100 percent!

{% include tweet_quote.html quote_text="With npm@5, you don't need to brew coffee anymore during waiting time!" %}

![Install express via npm 5](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/nodenpm/installexpressnpm.png)

Oh yeah! npm is now faster than Yarn!

### 2. Lockfiles

With `npm@5`, lockfiles are the default (`package-lock.json`). This simply means that whatever files you get when you install a package will be the same every time you install that package after initial install. This eliminates the challenges developers had with having different files on different developer environments after installing the same package.

![lockfiles](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/npm5/package-lock.png)

### 3. SHA-512 Hash

The npm CLI will use `sha512` for tarballs from registries that sends a `sha512` checksum as the tarball hash. `npm@5` publishes with SHA-512 hashes. This is to protect a developer against malicious attacks by checking downloaded packages and ensuring that code downloaded from the registry is safe and unwavering!

### 4. Saves by default

All installs save by default with `npm@5`. Adding the `--save` flag is no longer necessary. If you don't want to save the installed package, add the `--no-save` flag.

### 5. Install Report Summary

`npm@5` doesn't show the whole installed tree on your screen anymore. Instead, you'll see a summary report of the install on your screen like so:

![Install report summary](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/npm5/summary.png)

`Added 2 packages in 0.599s`

### 6. Automatic Fallback to Offline mode

`npm@5` will use your cache if you are offline to install packages that have been installed before but are no longer available maybe due to accidental `node_modules` folder deletion. Check this out:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">this is fun. <a href="https://t.co/gVakQFVfax">pic.twitter.com/gVakQFVfax</a></p>&mdash; âœ¨11x gayer Katâœ¨ (@maybekatz) <a href="https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/854176565587984384">April 18, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


`npm@5` shipped with a lot of changes that I might not be able to mention in this article. However, do well to check the full list of changes from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases).


## Aside: Using Auth0 with npm@5

**Auth0** issues [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) on every login for your users. This means that you can have a solid [identity infrastructure](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), including [single sign-on](https://auth0.com/docs/sso/single-sign-on), [user management](https://auth0.com/user-management), support for social identity providers (Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, etc.), enterprise identity providers (Active Directory, LDAP, SAML, etc.) and your own database of users with just a few lines of code.

> Auth0 provides the simplest and easiest to use [user interface tools to help administrators manage user identities](https://auth0.com/user-management) including password resets, creating and provisioning, blocking and deleting users. [A generous **free tier**](https://auth0.com/pricing) is offered so you can get started with modern authentication.

We can easily set up authentication in our JavaScript apps by using [Auth0's Centralized Login Page](https://auth0.com/docs/hosted-pages/login).

![Centralized Login Page](https://cdn2.auth0.com/docs/media/articles/web/hosted-login.png)
_Centralized Login Page_

It's as easy as installing the `auth0-js` and `jwt-decode` node modules like so:

```bash
npm install auth0-js jwt-decode --save
```

And using them like so:

```js
import auth0 from 'auth0-js';

const auth0 = new auth0.WebAuth({
    clientID: "YOUR-AUTH0-CLIENT-ID",
    domain: "YOUR-AUTH0-DOMAIN",
    scope: "openid email profile YOUR-ADDITIONAL-SCOPES",
    audience: "YOUR-API-AUDIENCES", // See https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth
    responseType: "token id_token",
    redirectUri: "http://localhost:9000" //YOUR-REDIRECT-URL
});

function logout() {
    localStorage.removeItem('id_token');
    localStorage.removeItem('access_token');
    window.location.href = "/";
}

function showProfileInfo(profile) {
    var btnLogin = document.getElementById('btn-login');
    var btnLogout = document.getElementById('btn-logout');
    var avatar = document.getElementById('avatar');
    document.getElementById('nickname').textContent = profile.nickname;
    btnLogin.style.display = "none";
    avatar.src = profile.picture;
    avatar.style.display = "block";
    btnLogout.style.display = "block";
}

function retrieveProfile() {
    var idToken = localStorage.getItem('id_token');
    if (idToken) {
        try {
            const profile = jwt_decode(idToken);
            showProfileInfo(profile);
        } catch (err) {
            alert('There was an error getting the profile: ' + err.message);
        }
    }
}

auth0.parseHash(window.location.hash, (err, result) => {
    if(err || !result) {
        // Handle error
        return;
    }

    // You can use the ID token to get user information in the frontend.
    localStorage.setItem('id_token', result.idToken);
    // You can use this token to interact with server-side APIs.
    localStorage.setItem('access_token', result.accessToken);
    retrieveProfile();
});

function afterLoad() {
    // buttons
    var btnLogin = document.getElementById('btn-login');
    var btnLogout = document.getElementById('btn-logout');

    btnLogin.addEventListener('click', function () {
        auth0.authorize();
    });

    btnLogout.addEventListener('click', function () {
        logout();
    });

    retrieveProfile();
}

window.addEventListener('load', afterLoad);
```

It installs the `auth0-js` library within seconds and locks down the exact files with `package-lock.json` file. If you don't already have an Auth0 account, <a href="https://auth0.com/signup" data-amp-replace="CLIENT_ID" data-amp-addparams="anonId=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name)">sign up</a> for one now. Navigate to the Auth0 [management dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/), select **Applications** from the navigational menu, then select the app you want to connect with the JavaScript framework of your choice. Now head over to the [Quickstart docs](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstarts), select the type of app you want to build and follow the steps highlighted there.

## Conclusion

**Node.js 8** and **npm5** came loaded with lots of new features and significant improvements. I couldn't be more proud of the JavaScript and Open source community right now. Is [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) going to release something super amazing soon? Maybe a faster install experience? I'll be on the look out!
