We are moving from the deprectad [Google Apps Provisioning API](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/provisioning/) to the new [Google Apps Directory API](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/).

__This will affect you only if you are using Google Apps and the `/users` endpoints of Auth0.

<!-- more -->

Google Apps Provisioning API has been deprectated few months ago, on the other hand the new API has some advantages like providing a public link for the profile photo and having more granular scopes.

__Previously permisive scope:__

__New granular scope:__

In order to have access to this API enable the "Admin SDK" service in the [Google API Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console) as follows:

New __Google Apps Connections__ will automatically use this new API and pre-existing connections will need to be re-provisioned by following the provisioning link. If you are the domain administrator follow this link, if not copy and send the link to the domain admin:

Until you have done this step, the `/users` endpoint will return only the users that have signed in to your app at least once.
